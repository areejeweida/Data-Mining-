# Project Title 

Data mining project - Checkpoint #1

In this step we web scrape data of 100 restaurants from OpenTable website.

main URL: https://www.opentable.com/m/best-restaurants-in-america-for-2017/

We create a main class 'Restaurant', and for each one of the methods is a feature we extract from the restaurant link 
where HTTP requests are done by requests library and then we parse HTML pages using BeautifulSoup library.
