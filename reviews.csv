90,Atera,New York Area,"OK. I'm not one for superlatives, but I have to say that my dinner at  Atera was the best dining experience one could ever hope for. From the minute you are greeted, until your departure 9 close to three hours later), you are pampered and fed like never before. It was our 25th anniversary, and every staff member knew about it, congratulated us (by name), and made our night feel so extra special. Once one of the amazing staff, David, found out that I was Grateful Dead fan, the music (which was played at the perfect volume) featured a wonderful set of Dead tunes. Now the food: in a word-- beyond. Seventeen courses. Not too stingy, not too much. Actually had to make room for the last two savory courses. (There's always room for dessert-- courses 16 and 17). I did the temperance drink pairing-- crazy inventive and fun (not a must, but if you have a few $ you don't mind spending, it adds a nice comic dimension to an otherwise very serious and very delicious tasting menu. Chef Ronny is on hand (and is very hands on) overseeing every detail.  He is 35, looks like he is 25, and cooks like he's been doing this forever. This is one restaurant experience you cannot miss. As an aside: We stayed over at 11Howard- a beautiful boutique hotel nearby. Had the 6pm Atera seating. Went to AIRE ancient baths after dinner (9-10:30pm)-- around the block-- for an amazing post-dinner spa experience. If you want to be a hero, treat your special someone to a night like this-- it won't be soon forgotten!Extra shout out to David at Atera-- thank you for a very special evening.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,2020-02-21 00:00:00.000000,True,Deidz60,34

The cuisine was creative and flavorful (think Kaluga caviar paired with a quenelle of pistachio gelato and IPA), but I can't honestly think of a single course that I would request again.

The prosciutto was perfect and the serving was so generous. I had the special lobster ravioli with black truffle in lobster bisque. It was as amazing as it sounds. I could not stop  till my husband gave me a piece of his rib eye. It was flavored perfectly with the sea salt that reminded me of Hawaiian sea salt (I’m born and raised on Maui) it was tender and tasted like wagyu. I left giggling and extremely happy.

There is an additional dining room in the ""dungeon"" which provides less noise and more privacy. The food is pricey and I would suffice it to say that you do not necessarily get your money's worth. The portions are relatively small. The filet mignon and lamb chops were average. However, the crab was excellent! The service is attentive.

Most of the starting tastes were delicious, but some of the main courses were not very good.  The xiao long bao and beef courses were excellent, but the soup was rather bland and the BBQ quail had an overwhelming smoke flavor that was unappealing.

The only flaw to our evening, one which was not under the control of the waitstaff was the loud talking from a nearby table of business people who could not have actually been eating, or at least not really savoring what was being brought to them.  The food itself was totally worth the price, which is admittedly not for the faint of heart.  You cannot get these dishes anywhere else and the ingredients are rare or difficult to source. The wine offerings were similarly stunning and so were the prices for wines by the glass, which added substantially to our final bill.

I’m not usually a lettuce wrap kind of guy either. We split the Manda Herb Salad with chicken and Tom Khem (short ribs and pork belly) and they balanced each other nicely. The short ribs were a little dry, but the gravy and fatty pork belly balanced them out well and they tasted delicious. The salad was really nicely balanced. The food is about $20 per entree, but we have enough leftovers for both of our lunches tomorrow, so the value is good for the price.After the waiter packed up our food, he brought us some complimentary macarons to celebrate our anniversary. They were the best macarons we’ve ever had, and I’ve been to Paris. To cleanse our palates at the end of the meal, they served us each a small shot of lemon juice, lime juice, and ginger, which was a great way to wrap up the wonderful experience.

You really just can't believe how wonderful it all is! Best food we have ever had, in any restaurant, anywhere! No exaggeration. When our daughter got up to use the restroom, a waiter refolded her napkin, so when she came back it was just like new. A nice touch! Attention to every detail imaginable! I love the detailed description of each course, by our server when they brought our food. For her birthday, they brought out the most amazing chocolate dessert, remembering that she was gluten free.

We hosted our friend for dinner, and tho she's lived here for over 25 years, this was her first time at Monarch.  It was a truly wonderful evening!  As always, the wait staff (Noah helped us out on this occasion) is knowledgable, attentive and truly seems to enjoy every part of the job at Monarch.  Having been closed due to Covid for 2 months, Noah was ecstatic to be back at work!  The food choices, and willingness of the kitchen to adapt to individual tastes and needs, are marvelous.  We all had the cauliflower soup, which is my perennial favorite 1st course here.  Two of us had the soft-shell crab and our friend had the compressed watermelon salad as the 2nd course, and we all enjoyed every bite.  I had the rib eye and stuffed zucchini blossom next and they had the lobster raviolo and we were all happy.  My entree was the Ahi; they had the seafood with gnocchi and we all agreed we had made excellent choices.  We have learned over time that doing the wine pairings not only provides us with a wonderful opportunity to try new wines, but with the wait staff all being sommeliers, it adds to the evenings drama and pleasure.

So we sat and decided the entire order which I then shared with waitress. I ordered lots of food and then asked if we could order more just in case we wanted more afterwards and was told that it depended on whether or not they needed to turn the table. The sides came out first and after a few minutes we served them and them finally ate them before the meet arrived.

The only dish that my made my partner and I look at each other and say anything other than, ""Wow, this is perfect,"" was, surprisingly enough, the meat entree. We ordered the Porcini Rubbed Beef Short Ribs, and I have to say that the salsa verde was more enjoyable than the meat itself. They tasted overcooked and were somewhat lacking in flavor. That being said, we still cleaned the plate as the short ribs would still blow most out of the water - even if they didn't live up to the chi Spacca standard. Our service didn't meet the typical standard of a award-winning restaurant, either. Our server was not very attentive and we had empty, dirty plates stacked in front us more than once, though I suppose this is better than an over-attentive server, and it may be because we chose counter seating rather than a table.

First, we were seated 45 minutes after our reservation, and then it took another 30 just to get service. The restaurant has about 5 tables total, so the fact we RARELY saw our waiter the entire TWO HOURS it took to eat was also extremely unfortunate. The courses came out 30 minutes apart, which was very strange to have a bowl of mashed potatoes sit there for half an hour until the first meat came out. Our waters were never filled, and I think I only got one beer the entire meal because our waiter literally never came back after we ordered our food. Except one time to apologize for how long everything was taking. I will say they gave us complimentary sorbet at the end, probably because it was now 11PM and we were just eating. While the food is tasty, I really don't believe the restaurant is as fine as it seems to have convinced itself it is.

For the amount we paid for this “special Valentine’s dinner” (we were celebrating my husband’s birthday), the 7- course menu (excluding the amuse bouche and petit fours) was “just ok”. I didn’t want to use mediocre to describe it, as there were some fantastic elements like the Dry aged duck and red apple consommé en gelèe.  Everything else fell flat in my opinion. I just didn’t think it was worth that kind of money. For a very steep price tag of $1K, every bite should’ve elicited a “wow!”, but it didn’t. Not to mention from a Michelin rated restaurant at that. To add insult to injury, our server announced at the start of dinner that they have added a dish to their menu which is Risotto and black truffle for an additional $50 pp. We declined, as we’ve anticipated a wonderful evening ahead of us. We couldn’t have been more wrong.  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere. Per Se, Jean Georges, and Le Bernardin would be considered reasonable compared to GK, with amazing food to boot. Alinea in Chicago is very much worth the price tag - from start to finish. You would leave on cloud 9 and have the fondest experience ever ( we still dream about it to this day).

Perfectly balanced umami with a light hand of truffles. So pleased to see an innovative way to prepare sea bass using ramen and mushrooms. The elk was closer to traditional with mashed potatoes and button mushrooms, but so tender it made me a fan again after so many previous tough experiences.

989,Girl & the Goat,Chicago,"We had a 5:30P reservation on Tuesday night and were lucky enough to get seated at one of the Chefâ€™s Table. We had the opportunity to watch Chef Izard expedite orders and the chefs in the kitchen. The chefs interacted with us as their workload allowed. It was an awesome experience for foodies. We ordered the bacon Gouda bread, kohlrabi salad, branzino, crispy short rib, and goat belly confit. The bread was good, but unnecessary if youâ€™re looking to save room and calories for other items on the menu. The kohlrabi salad was delicious! My non-veggie eating husband went back for seconds and thirds and named the dish his favorite of the meal. We highly recommend it. The Branzino was my favorite dish of the meal. The chef responsible for preparing the fish was stationed right in front of our table, so we got to see its preparation. Served whole, this dish may be intimidating to some, but the crispy skin, tender meat, and the crunchy farro paired with the sauce was the PERFECT bite. Another dish that we highly recommend. The crispy short ribs were perfectly crispy on outside and tender on the inside and were paired with grapefruit and avocado. The meal itself was delicious, but the dish itself wasnâ€™t our favorite- too citrus forward for our liking. The goat belly confit was paired with crab and a vanilla sauce, and a composed bite of that dish made me drop my fork and close my eyes. It was PERFECTION!! Chef Izard ordered us a mini portion of the green beans on the house, and they were delicious! The beans were so perfectly charred and paired with sliced cashew and a garlic sesame sauce. Neither of us are huge fans of green beans, but this dish challenged our opinion. Again, highly recommend. To finish the meal, we ordered the Carmel corn & malt balls. Our server mentioned that it was one of their most popular desserts, and it was truly delicious. There was an unique contrast between the luxurious ice cream and the crunchy corn.

We ate the Ora King Salmon Poke, Pig Face, Duck Tartare, Pork Shank, Escargot Ravioli, Apple Gjetost Pierogi and drank the Goat's Choice (Scotch, Beet Juice, Lime) and Don't Carrot All What You Think. We had the Gets Better with Sage and Fireside at the bar while waiting for the table; top notch drinks. The Ora King Salmon Poke was the most flavorful and impressive dish followed by the Duck and Pig Face. The Pork Shank was surprisingly over salted so we took it home to add some sugar for balance. We sat at a two seat, slim table behind a barrier to the people getting trashed at the bar. I understand the West Loop is getting more expensive with each Instagram-flex post and want to make use of each square footage, however, the restaurant should reconsider the layout of sitting a two person table near the super loud bar and kitchen area that will make any introverted foodie lose their enjoyment of food.

1038,Giulia Restaurant,New England,"Generally Giulia lives up to its high reputation; among other points, it is an entirely successful Italian substitute for the sort of high-quality classic French cuisine that has more or less vanished from Boston in the last decade. Our octopus starter with Umbrian lentils was delicious, but outmatched both by the pasta and steak, both of which my partner and I shared. Although everything was done to perfection, the mushroom and kale elements in the pasta sauce and the aioli accompanying the steak were particularly superb. The selection of Italian wines by the glass was slightly narrow but excellent.In reviewing a restaurant of Giulia's quality, it is surely not churlish to cavil at minor slips. Prosecco was rather too close to room temperature. More seriously, the pudding selection was unambitious and strikingly Americanized: no proper Italian pastry was on offer, nor was a cheese option, which by definition requires comparatively little preparation.

You hear interesting tidbits and stories. You bond with your bartender and your imagination won't run wild with ideas that you're not important or that this speakeasy is too pretentious. It's not.While the drink menu was a little more limited what I had was great. A truly spicy cocktail with smoky mezcal? Sign me up. Best part? The bartender can customize to your tastes and needs. My friend thought her old fashioned was too sweet. 'No problem, allow me to make you something like a vieux carre and here's exactly why I am using what I am using.' And then thoughtful bar bites which weren't an afterthought for the drink but actually tasty? Gimme that Chicken Tinga Sandwich and an order of the lamb chops for my homegirl please! The R&B music (yaaasssss! to that) had me swaying, the drinks had me relaxed and the convo had me joyful--  this was a laid back speakeasy experience (And trust me, I've tried many in the area).Four stars because it was great time but it truly was a LITTLE too dim and there could be more drinks but I loved this place.

1201,Heirloom Cafe,Toronto,"I'll begin this review by saying that I had been looking forward to, and tried to find an occasion to visit Heirloom Cafe for a very long time. I've lived in San Francisco now for a year and have had dozens of dining recommendations, but I found this one on my own and was excited to visit a local gem in my neighborhood of the Mission. When one of my hometown friends visited, I wanted to bring her, and my local friend in SF for a ladies' dinner on a Saturday night. The food - delicious, presentable, a great portion. We had the fettucine and salmon and both were divine. The wine selection - abundant, knowledgeable, perfectly dry white and rosé to our taste preferences. The ambiance - candlelit, dim, great for close colleagues, friends, or a date. What completely turned us off however, was one of the servers.1. She seemed to be under the influence. Her words were slurred, and she approached our table in jerky movements.2. Our third guest arrived a bit after us, and about a minute after sitting down, the server came to our table and said ""What's the gameplan"" without asking to see if she had a chance to review the menu and decide  3. She accidentally knocked over the entire water decanter onto my friend's seating area, lap, and jacket. she didn't apologize but instead said ""it can be refreshing"". she continued to wipe it while not noticing that she was carrying 2 more decanters in her arm that continued to pour out - luckily a few other servers came to dry up the area 4. We left a nominal tip instead, and she came to the table while we were sitting there, stared closely at the receipt, and marched away to show her manager. Heirloom cafe: your other servers, from what we could tell, seemed to provide good service. We also spoke a few times to who we believe might be an owner and he was great. You should re-consider this server that has left an incredibly bad taste in our mouths and we will not be returning, nor recommending it.",2,5.0,1.0,4.0,2019-08-17 00:00:00.000000,False,mcsdagds,1

We were both full, but not uncomfortably so. There's no way we could have eaten more!

Overall, it was what I expected: spaced out patio tables, disposable menus and dinnerware, masked servers who were conscious not to socialize too much and to stay a respectful distance away from the table. The sidewalk traffic that passed our table was minimal.  Pickup orders were around the corner, which allowed for a quiet and safer dining experience. The food and drinks were outstanding as always.

1285,The Inn at Little Washington,Washington DC,"We visited the Inn last night for our 5th wedding anniversary. This was our first time at the Inn and we appreciate the opportunity. I am going to be honest with my review and please keep in mind that this is my personal opinion. It might sound nitpicky but I think that you earn the right to nitpick if you shell out this amount of money for food :)I have been to one other restaurant with a similar structure and that is Marcel's by Robert Wiedmaier in DC. We went there for our 1st wedding anniversary so I will compare both restaurants.The quality of the cuisine is similar at both restaurants and there is very little that sets them apart. The wine pairing and selections was outstanding at both restaurants. Marcel's provided multiple ""entremets"" between courses and the Inn did not do so. When it comes to table service, the only area where the Inn performed better than Marcel's was the enthusiasm and interaction we received from the waiter, Andrew. However, the waiter at Marcel's was still very good. He performed all his table service at a higher level of technical service. The table was cleaned thoroughly and properly in between courses by Marcel's while at the Inn the table was just not cleaned and cleared properly. The waiter at the table next to us dropped used utensils on a customer which is a massive offense for a 3 star restaurant. Additionally, the sommelier at the Inn poured the incorrect for the wine pairing at dessert. While the experience at both restaurants was very good, Marcel's provided a slightly better dining experience. We certainly did not leave hungry from the Inn and are glad to have the opportunity to dine at an acclaimed restaurant, we think that these little things are worth noting when dining at a restaurant of this level.",4,,,,2019-08-18 00:00:00.000000,False,rosiro,4

For example, if I haven tried Marcel’s boudin blanc, I would say it’s great. But, I have to say Marcel’s is better.  And, I would stay away from their Moulard Duck Foi Gras Confit.

1631,Lahaina Grill,,"Wife and I went here after receiving a $100 gift card from my sister.  To be fair, we would never have gone here if not for the gift card after seeing the prices, we just don't dine at expensive restaurants.  Wife had Pacific Salmon ($49) and I had Boneless Short Rib ($46).  Neither of us drink alcohol.  Wife's Salmon was to come with Asparagus, came with String Beans instead.  Waitress and table assistant did come by a bit but nothing special about the service (I would imagine if we got drinks and an appetizer they would have come by more often but not much of a need with just us getting the dinner plate with no desert).  Her Salmon was OK as was my Boneless Rib but nothing special tasting.  Inside was nice but nothing special and a bit noisy even though we weren't in the main dining area.  No place to park close and plan on $10 or more paid parking unless a few blocks away ($5).  Gift card covered the meals, gave a $20 cash tip.  If you like expensive dinners this place may be good with you, check out the cost with the online menu. We much prefer the Okazuya & Deli Honokowai at 3600D Lower Honoapiilani.  If you've never been there go (take cash, they do not accept credit card and closed on Sundays).  Average dinner price is $17-18, the Mahi Mahi (includes two sides) is unbelievably good as is everything on the menu, it's TAKE OUT so it's perfect for beach dinning or at a condo lanai.  Wish sis had given us cash for us to use where we wanted, but her thought was in the right place.",4,4.0,4.0,4.0,2020-03-08 00:00:00.000000,False,RobertM,1

We ate inside; they also have tables outside, but at 90 degrees inside was better.My choices: warm shrimp salad and trout with almonds.  Salad was phenomenal, due to perfectly cooked shrimp and ripe avocado along with the greens. Trout was perfect. Spouse had foie gras pate, incredibly smooth, and the Tuesday night lobster risotto special.  Both really good--lobster cooked perfectly.  Splurged on an expensive bottle of white Burgundy.  Perfect with these dishes.When restaurants open fully, Le Diplomate will return to being packed.  Good for them, even though that means it will again be tough to get a reservation.

It may sound/seem simple, but that was one of the best salads we’ve ever had. We were also given the Hiramasa tartare dish, which my boyfriend declared the best tartare dish he’s ever had. I had the half chicken (cooked under a brick), and he had the halibut - both outrageous. We had the carrot cake for dessert, but we were also given what the waiter called, ‘The Egg.’ He basically told us to move back in our seats a bit as he proceeded to toss a white chocolate egg filled with passion fruit into a plate ... it was as hysterical as it was delicious, and my boyfriend does not like passion fruit. There are no words that can properly describe this experience.

The vegetables were fresh and the cooking afforded succulent, wonderful tasting options.

Regarding the Brodetto, The broth, while absolutely delicious, was served warm to start with and cooled to room temperature by the end of the dish.If you are looking for calm, culture, civility, this place is it. If, however, you were looking simply for amazing food, you may find yourself a little disappointed.

I did not complain...at least I thot the tart was edible, but could not explain the taste.My baby gem lettuce salad was ok,  but not as lovely as I expiated, to the eye and the tongue.My friend was aghast that the soup of the day cost 24 dollars, but she ordered it as she was not very hungry (we lunched early...ll:45 )...I was so devastated that I considered, and still am ,  writing directly to Danny Meyer.  He would be horrified had he been at our table yesterday Aug 30. I will not be returning to The Modern, unless an explanation is given.

Comparing Orchids to the old Maisonette, Boca and Restaurant L (the three legitimate 5-star restaurants we've been to) is a real challenge. Orchids' service staff was above outstanding. Quiet and efficient, the table was cleaned and readied for the next course. The food was wondrous. The seared foie gras, Spanish mackerel, made us want more. The first plates are intentionally small and left us wanting more. Our Monkfish was superbly prepared and surrounded by great food. The chocolate dessert was a wonder. We can't say enough positive about Orchids/ We can also mention that the price was relatively low. Orchids is an unqualified winner.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,2020-02-28 00:00:00.000000,False,RFO2,26

The service is highly attentive and the pacing of the meal was spot on. It was fascinating to watch the choreography of the staff (and the service is clearly choreographed). The staff was friendly, but with a degree of professional aloofness given the more formal dining setting. The prices are expensive although not out of range for the setting. However, the food itself, while well prepared and presented, did not have the distinctive, memorable taste that would befit the prices. I had the ribeye which was well prepared and tasty, but not distinctive. My wife had the flounder which was disappointing in the portion size, taste and accompaniments. We opted to not have dessert, but the restaurant provided some petit fors which were the highlight of the meal.

2264,Orchids at Palm Court,Cincinnati,"This was my second time dining at Orchids at Palm Court.  The first time I dined here was last year and it was fantastic.  This year was a different story.  To start off, it should be noted that this is a relatively expensive restaurant and therefore comes with certain expectations beyond food, service and ambiance being two of them.  We were seated by a very friendly, knowledgeable, and professional greeter, Morgan.  Our server, Oscar, was also very professional.  However, it took 40 minutes from the time we were seated to meet Oscar.  He was extremely busy and for a Saturday night Orchids was poorly staffed--labor cuts?  In any event, we were looking forward to the actual meal.  My wife ordered the blue cheese beignet salad, popcorn grits, and scallops.  I ordered the beef cheek perogies, maitake/cappelletti, and lamb.  My wife's salad was very overdressed and almost seemed as if there was too much salad dressing on it, then the chefs decided to pour olive oil on it--what a disappointment.  The popcorn grits, on the other hand, were flavorful and delicious and I would definitely recommend this unique and tasty dish!  And my wife's third course of scallops were cooked perfectly.  My order was a different story.  First, my perogies had absolutely no flavor whatsoever-no salt, pepper, herb, or sauce-and therefore was unsurprisingly very bland.  The maitake and cappelletti were terrific and cooked perfectly, and the sauce was a perfect pairing (you should order this).  But sadly, my entrée was lackluster.  The lamb was almost rare and had, once again, no flavor.  The entrée did come with two bites of lamb sausage and creamy polenta, but the what should have been the star of the plate, the protein, disappointed in flavor and the way it was cooked.Along with service being painfully slow, the staff always seemed rushed and in a hurry to leave the table.  The staff was so hurried that for our second course they gave my wife and me the wrong second course.  Loud patrons.",2,2.0,2.0,1.0,2020-01-25 00:00:00.000000,False,Kyle,8

2470,Polo Lounge @ The Beverly Hills Hotel,Las Vegas,Went to just have a small snack and some drinks. The environment felt very pretentious and the staff seemed to care more about high end guests vs people just wanting to experience the Beverly Hills hotel. I made reservations serval weeks in advance and then felt a little uncomfortable where they sat us. Also waiter forgot to bring our appetizer which ended up being the only thing we ordered because we were tired of waiting. It’s a beautiful place but I’ve been to many many high end restaurants and I’ve never felt more uncomfortable. I was even dressed well and carried a designer bag just to try and fit in more but that didn’t seem to make a difference. I don’t need to go back. Ps the chips and salsa and guacamole are awful. Don’t order it. Besides that it was a beautiful hotel and their waiters seem very well trained. Overall I’d give it 4 stars.,3,4.0,3.0,5.0,2020-02-16 00:00:00.000000,False,OpenTable Diner,1

We then had a glass of cab and a Chardonnay that were recommended and they were awful. The cab tatted tainted and the Chardonnay from Mayacamas was really odd tasting. We ordered some fish and a steak and they were not very good. The halibut was tasteless and served cold. The sauce was even worse. The steak was served medium rare after asking for medium well.

She also brought us a variety of readers when our waitress only brought one pair that were too strong for someone that needed it so I appreciated her so much because I would not have been happy with our experience at all if it wasn't for her. You could tell she cared about our experience which I really appreciated. Also there was a misunderstanding with our waitress on the salads and who was splitting what so we had to order another salad because the way it was split up (which I appreciated that they split them for us), there was a person that was left out and was not brought out a salad.

The upscale, but comfortable and almost historical feel of the place assured us that we made a good choice. Our experience only got better from there. We were greeted my Paco himself before we were taken to our table by a very friendly hostess. Shortly thereafter our waitress introduced herself and brought us a lovely plate of ribboned plantains with chimichurri sauce and “Paco Pico” sauce. The light and crunchy plantains successfully served to whet our appetite for the rest of our highly-anticipated meal. My husband and I shared a plate of escargot. The delightfully soft and warm bread that accompanied the dish was quite pleasing. As we were there to celebrate our anniversary, we ordered a Prosecco cocktail that was enhanced by hibiscus syrup with candied Hibiscus at the bottom of our glasses. It was a great Segway into our main course. My favorite thing about Galveston seafood restaurants is that they know how to prepare gulf coast seafood- Rudy and Paco’s treatment of the red snapper that I ordered was painstakingly good! It was cooked to perfection and adorned (not overdressed) by avocado, Paco Pico, and lump crab meat...good stuff!  My husband wasn’t too fond of the scallops dish he ordered stating that they were “cold and not very flavorful.” Aside from that, the wine selection was ample, and my tres leches dessert was heavenly! It was swimming in the milks that flavored each drenched and spongy bite! My only critique, if I have to list one, is that the sides are lacking. Although I am a purist, and I like my veggies plain and lightly steamed which they executed successfully, I feel that a restaurant of their caliber should step up their sides game. I loved the brocolini, but I would have appreciated a wider range of sides from which to choose such as a lively beet salad to compliment that beautiful piece of fish.

I discreetly asked about their meal status (wrapping up, etc.), and the lovely waitress shared that they had finished - not so. I had to endure their political and gossipy conversation for an hour - could not wait to leave.

It is quaint, although located in a strip mall, they have done  good job of making the inside feel warm and inviting.  The attention to detail was nice.  Things like seating us apart from other diners when the restaurant was not yet full (we were there at 5:30) and offering dark linen because we were wearing black were appreciated. Aso,asking about allergies before beginning service, and waiting for our complete order so that the plating of all courses could be expertly timed.   Our favorite was the coquilles st jacques appetizer.  The beef bourguignon was hearty and delicious and my filet was actually medium rare which almost never happens. ( I do wish i had felt more adventurous and ordered maybe the fish special, because I decided I do prefer a good amount of char on a grilled steak, but that is personal preference. ) The butter cookies to take home were a lovely touch.

It is barely above the dreaded “food on a plate” category, it is far short of artful. 2) Attire of assistant waiters who all wear printed black tee shirts, fine at the shore but it is not the dress of a 5 star restaurant. 3) Blatant racism in work expectations. Waiters almost all seem to be white work at a good pace and take the time to be pleasant, assistants in black tee shirts work at a frenzied pace of a car wash as if expecting to be fired at any second. Almost all of the sub class appear to be Hispanic. This just isn’t seen anymore.

I was lucky to eat here last year and had an absolutely fantastic experience - which made me even more dissapointed in my most recent experience. My brother has celiac disease, which can be an issue at other restaurants, but Sushi Nakazawa reassured us that accommodating his dietary restrictions would not be an issue - we made sure to call ahead of time, remind the host, and checked with our waiter twice. But unfortunately, within an hour after eating, my brother was extremely sick. We had the same exact meal and I was completely fine. When you're paying the prices that you do at Sushi Nakazawa, and have been reassured that they can handle customers with celiac, it's quite frustrating when they fail to do so. The next day I called the restaurant to let them know what happened and the host kindly said they would have management follow-up, but 2 weeks have passed and I haven't heard anything - not even an apology. Shocking when you expect high quality customer service from a restaurant of this quality.

Also, I love bubbly wine with my meal and the only choice by the glass started at $17/glass.

The waitstaff can tell you the details of each one and why it goes with the particular dish. It's not overbearing wine-speak it's genuinely interesting information.

I had even seen photos and was delighted at the opportunity to go for my birthday. I think that some of my expectations were let down, as it’s as pretty but I think I expected a lot more ambiance from “the garden” than it offered in design. It was also much TOO dark. We were in the most lit area (right next to the light wall) and we had trouble seeing. Just to exit the restaurant my one friend had to use a flashlight. It’s definitely not disability friendly at all. The staff was nice, the food was great. Overall it was a lovely beautiful night, and the food was very satisfying. We ordered the beef short ribs (4.5 ⭐️), scallops (3.5 ⭐️) and beets (4 ⭐️). I’ll say the one uncomfortable moment was when waiting for the check to sign, I noticed a manager or higher up kept staring us down as if we were over staying out welcome. This kept on after we signed. It was a party of 4 at 9:30 at night, and we had barely stayed 65 minutes at that point with a 8:15p reservation.

We had a wonderful server who took our order for a nice bottle of wine (from a moderately interesting list). A runner then brought us the obligatory bread basket along with an amuse-bouche of vinegared beets, one of which he  overturned onto the table linens - but made no offer to even cover the large and expanding beet red amoeba shaped stain with a napkin.Our first courses - a nice potato potage and baked oysters with (I recall) Pernod were quite well prepared. Our mains, a duck breast and a fish with a leek and other vegetable purée were both well prepared - but suffered from an obvious many too many minutes late delay in getting from the kitchen to the table. We passed on desert as nothing on the limited selection spoke to us.This is a work in progress. Most of the “rough edges” we felt were managed around by a wonderful and obviously experienced server (who we well tipped) but it’s hard to not get the feeling that the front and back of the house need some more time working together.Last - it’s a fine dining restaurant.

The only thing actually worth eating were the oysters. Our meal was so disappointing we immediately walked to Friday, Saturday, Sunday where we know we can get a top-notch, perfectly executed meal with staff that don’t seem like robots.

Usually I don't like thicker pizzas but this one managed to be thick without being too heavy or soggy. The crust was crispy and the flavor was out of this world. We also enjoyed the burger very much.

The beginning was with a creatively tasty aperitivo, served with fois gras pastrami on a slice of brioche, high temperature baked and charred cauliflower, smoked duck breast and crudities with a balsamic mayonnaise. Then the serious food started.... hamachi crudo with a creative use of citrus to give it sparkle, onion crepe, with perfectly caramelized onion that took 2 days to make. We tried six different pastas, all delicious; however, for me the ricotta ravioli were incredible.... light as a feather, creamy, and, again, set off with a creative use of citrus In keeping with the season. The real showstopper were three perfectly cooked and sauced Nantucket scallops, topped with a generous serving of ostera caviar and tiny house-made potato chips. So good I felt we should eat this dish on our knees. Entrees hadn't even been started at this point. Spit-roasted goat... tender, juicy with crunchy skin and a salt-baked bronzino were secondi.

My wife has very distinct food dislikes and I am very adventurous and chef was marvelous at meeting both our preferences! The portions were small and manageable, the food was gorgeous and delicious.

Our server, Tara, came to our table and announced we were to have a discussion regarding what we enjoy eating and what we do not. Was there anything we felt we absolutely needed to try? Any ingredients of which we are particularly fond? I wish every restaurant with an unset tasting menu did this, it's brilliant. Ultimately, we did not choose any particular courses, so it was a surprise, but a surprise built around our tastes. There were six main courses, 3 bread courses, an amuse-bouche, and a couple mignardises. Every other main course had an additional entree we shared. Our tasting menus were completely different from one another, so we were able to try each other's entrees as well. Overall, we tried a little over 20 dishes. All of them were exquisite and definitely on the richer side. I was pretty full about two-thirds of the way through.What made the experience amazing, food aside, was our brilliant server. Tara is an absolute food genius, emotionally intelligent, and easy to understand. Her knowledge is vast and gave an immediate answers to every question without missing a single beat. Playful and understanding, she intuitively knew when to give us space as well as when to swoop in with another brilliant display.

You arrive & its quite chaotic, table wasn't ready upon arrival for our reservation for us & many others waiting in front of us.  Our server was the highlight of the night, she was great throughout our experience.  One of the items we came for was the famous Slow Cooked Lamb Shoulder.  When asked about it for the tasting menu, we were told they were out already, for a 7:30 reservation which is ridiculous when you can get bar seating without reservations earlier & can order it.  Our experience continued downhill from there.  Drinks took forever to come out & our food was coming out under cooked, over cooked & cold as we watched the table next to us who sat down 15 minutes after us & took forever to place their order get their food before us having also ordered the tasting menu.  Our steak looked well done while theirs came out right after ours looking as if it was just pulled off the grill.  They left & paid before us.  The ""pusher"" responsible for reviewing & releasing the food wasn't doing a great job.  We watched tables around us get food at completely random times with long waits, short wait & no cadence.  The food was rather forgetabble. We have an Israeli restuarant in Chicago that across the board all their dishes were better especially for the price.  The hot hummus was the best part of the meal.  Reservations are so hard to get & the fact you don't get asked during your reservation if you are interested in their signature dish would make one assume you can't request ahead of time but first come first serve.  There is no information regarding any of this on their website.  If you are going for that dish, get a bar seat or make 5pm reservations.

Also, I appreciated the personalized birthday message on the menu for my daughter and the birthday greetings from the waitstaff. There was only one problem which detracted significantly from our experience: the noise level. The music was so loud (and not particularly interesting or cool) that we couldn’t hear ourselves talk. We couldn’t even hear the servers trying to carefully explain the contents of each dish, which was a real bummer. I asked a few times for them to repeat what they said, but then I just gave up. We were very interested in knowing about each dish and chatting about that at dinner. That is kind of the point of a tasting menu.
