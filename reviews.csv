Atera,New York Area,"OK. I'm not one for superlatives, but I have to say that my dinner at  Atera was the best dining experience one could ever hope for. From the minute you are greeted, until your departure 9 close to three hours later), you are pampered and fed like never before. It was our 25th anniversary, and every staff member knew about it, congratulated us (by name), and made our night feel so extra special. Once one of the amazing staff, David, found out that I was Grateful Dead fan, the music (which was played at the perfect volume) featured a wonderful set of Dead tunes. Now the food: in a word-- beyond. Seventeen courses. Not too stingy, not too much. Actually had to make room for the last two savory courses. (There's always room for dessert-- courses 16 and 17). I did the temperance drink pairing-- crazy inventive and fun (not a must, but if you have a few $ you don't mind spending, it adds a nice comic dimension to an otherwise very serious and very delicious tasting menu. Chef Ronny is on hand (and is very hands on) overseeing every detail.  He is 35, looks like he is 25, and cooks like he's been doing this forever. This is one restaurant experience you cannot miss. As an aside: We stayed over at 11Howard- a beautiful boutique hotel nearby. Had the 6pm Atera seating. Went to AIRE ancient baths after dinner (9-10:30pm)-- around the block-- for an amazing post-dinner spa experience. If you want to be a hero, treat your special someone to a night like this-- it won't be soon forgotten!Extra shout out to David at Atera-- thank you for a very special evening.",5,5,5,5,2020-02-21 00:00:00,True

Atera,,"I was rather disappointed with Atera.  The food was fine; it is Michelin star grade.  But the atmosphere was too uptight, the chef looked angry and unhappy and one of the Scot servers was rude.  I am not able to enjoy food in a tense ambiance and for the price I paid I expected the entire staff, starting with the chef, to have minimum charm.  Some dishes were rather heavy:  I wished I had seen more creativity rather than the usual suspects: caviar, uni, foie gras and truffle oil.  I enjoyed the opening cocktail, the dumpling and the passion fruit mochi.  I am a bit concerned by the level of cholesterol that comes as part of the entire tasting menu.  Sadly I will not be coming back, nor will I recommend Atera to others.  Good luck.",2,3,3,1,2020-01-11 00:00:00,False

It felt a little ""Eyes Wide Shut"" when I first arrived; a very small, intimate dining area (there were only 17 guests for my seating), and the staff was completely silent in front of us to begin.  Service was flawless, and the team moved effortlessly among each other for 15 courses.  A great ballet, and amazing to watch.  The cuisine was creative and flavorful (think Kaluga caviar paired with a quenelle of pistachio gelato and IPA), but I can't honestly think of a single course that I would request again.  This show was all about the ceremony of the service and plate presentation.  I opted for the coursing paired with wine, and I enjoyed several varietals I'd never tried before; Bosco (blended with Vermentino) from Cinque Terre in Northern Italy, Mencia from Ribeira Sacra, Spain.",5,3,5,5,2019-12-24 00:00:00,True

The service was noteworthy.  Everything you would expect from a Michelin 2 star...and more.   I have never been to a restaurant where so much attention was given to your personal comfort and interests, in addition to proper and timely serving and removal of food and drink.  I would highly, highly recommend Atera.

Took forever to take our order..had a helper who was a bit nicer, but not a super friendly personality.  Food was OK.  Nothing spectacular.  From carpaccio, tuna tartare, and lobster bisque soup....ehhh 5 out of 10. Had a Prime ribeye, was OK....not really seasoned that much.  Dining partner had a Prime Strip...Not Good.

The sides were excellent-tater tots and truffle mac and cheese were as good as ever.  Deep dish cookie dessert was uninspired.

The prosciutto was perfect and the serving was so generous. I had the special lobster ravioli with black truffle in lobster bisque. It was as amazing as it sounds. I could not stop  till my husband gave me a piece of his rib eye. It was flavored perfectly with the sea salt that reminded me of Hawaiian sea salt (I’m born and raised on Maui) it was tender and tasted like wagyu. I left giggling and extremely happy. The meal was so incredible we had to call the restaurant to tell them and spoke to Tony who was so receptive and appreciative. Michael was our waiter and made the dining experience perfect.

Bavette's,Chicago,Bavetteâ€™s is by far my favorite restaurant.  We split oysters and shrimp which was very good.  Smoked salmon Caesar salad which was fabulous.

Bavette's,Chicago,I had been looking forward to my reservations for months.  It was a late night reservation due to availability.  We ordered an appetizer that was forgotten about until we reminded our server.  It was brought out moments before our entrÃ©e.  This put a damper on a highly anticipated date night for my husband's birthday.  The appetizer was later comped and service was good up until we had to flag down our server to get our dessert wrapped up to go.  Food was good but the service will not have me returning.

Bavette's,Chicago,"Took me several months to get a reservation but it was worth it. My wife and I went with my brother and his wife. For appetizers we ordered the steak tartare, shrimp cocktail and half dozen oysters. All were great. For steaks the bone in ribeye and the petite fillet. They were cooked perfectly with great flavor. For sides, the sweet potatoes, crab stuffed avocado salad, truffle mac and cheese and elote style corn. For me the elote style corn was the best but all were good. As for the wine, I highly recommend the Colombo Apertura Pinot Noir. One of the best wines I have had in a long time. No dessert unfortunately but if you see the amount of food we ordered you will understand why we passed.The ambiance of the place was also very cool. The music was great and the noise level was a little high but sitting in the booth we didn't have much difficulty hearing. There is a great bar area both upstairs and down. Only complaint is the restroom situation. They are single restrooms and there was at least one to two waiting in line. Not a big deal.Overall an excellent meal and great scene. Would love to go back so I better get to work trying to secure another reservation. People did walk in without a reservation and I overheard them being told hour thirty to an hour forty-five.

There is an additional dining room in the ""dungeon"" which provides less noise and more privacy. The food is pricey and I would suffice it to say that you do not necessarily get your money's worth. The portions are relatively small. The filet mignon and lamb chops were average. However, the crab was excellent! The service is attentive.

The timing of the dishes coming out was excellent and we found the servers to be professional and also very charming.  The food, though, fell a bit short of expectations for a 3-star restaurant.  Most of the starting tastes were delicious, but some of the main courses were not very good.  The xiao long bao and beef courses were excellent, but the soup was rather bland and the BBQ quail had an overwhelming smoke flavor that was unappealing.  After dining at Quince, Acquerello, and Manresa, we were disappointed in the food at Benu.

They were eager to answer questions and seemed to enjoy how much we were enjoying the experience.  I loved the presentation of each delicacy in a special bowl or on a plate made just for that offering.  The only flaw to our evening, one which was not under the control of the waitstaff was the loud talking from a nearby table of business people who could not have actually been eating, or at least not really savoring what was being brought to them.  The food itself was totally worth the price, which is admittedly not for the faint of heart.  You cannot get these dishes anywhere else and the ingredients are rare or difficult to source. The wine offerings were similarly stunning and so were the prices for wines by the glass, which added substantially to our final bill.  It was a special event for us, so we didn't mind the loud conversation nearby us nor the final bill-- we were prepared for that .  It was an epic evening.",5,5,5,4,2020-01-28 00:00:00,False

They start by bringing out some complimentary shrimp chips, which were really pleasant. Our waiter recommended the lettuce wraps as an appetizer and they were hands down the best dish of the night... I’m not usually a lettuce wrap kind of guy either. We split the Manda Herb Salad with chicken and Tom Khem (short ribs and pork belly) and they balanced each other nicely. The short ribs were a little dry, but the gravy and fatty pork belly balanced them out well and they tasted delicious. The salad was really nicely balanced. The food is about $20 per entree, but we have enough leftovers for both of our lunches tomorrow, so the value is good for the price.After the waiter packed up our food, he brought us some complimentary macarons to celebrate our anniversary. They were the best macarons we’ve ever had, and I’ve been to Paris. To cleanse our palates at the end of the meal, they served us each a small shot of lemon juice, lime juice, and ginger, which was a great way to wrap up the wonderful experience.

But it is really a 6 or 7 course dining experience if you add their chef’s little tasting, the foie gras that is a MUST, and of course a dessert. An extensive wine by the glass, creative cocktails and special wine pairings are in addition to an even more impressive wine list. Plan on 3 hours of bliss.",5,5,5,5,2020-06-27 18:37:53.269418,True

Café Monarch,Las Vegas,"Cafe Monarch is a nice AZ fine dining restaurant with good food.  Service was okay, but did not measure up to the hype.  Our waiter seemed like a super nice guy but forgot which course we were on, tried to pour us the same wine we already had with a previous course, got confused who was having what to eat and seemed nervous and not confident.  For me the service can make or break a dining experience and I am saddened that our service was sub-par for the expectation/price of the meal.  The food was good, but not great.  Cauliflower soup was the best course for everyone.  Mushroom stack, blah, skip it, too greasy, veggie lasagna was over sauced with what tasted like tomato paste.  On the other hand, the cocktails were great!  At the end, we wished we sat at the bar and just ate the soup and drank the cocktails! We all left feeling like we were let down.",3,4,3,4,2020-06-13 00:00:00,True

We each had a different offering on each of the courses, except for the third course of lobster raviolo (truly a must have). By the time we finished our four courses, there was no room for the complimentary desert, however, the wait staff promptly boxed it up so we could enjoy it at home.

chi SPACCA,Los Angeles,"Those steaks were super delicious as well as salad, side of veggies and deserts :) It was in the evening a day before all LA restaurants started close and serve only take-out orders. Seemed many customers cancelled reservations, very unusual to see empty tables, dining just few customers. Top class food for sure, at same time cozy and casual atmosphere, I wish they make a little more reasonable prices. Like, 36 oz bone-in ribeye steak was $205 that perfect size to share for 2, $102.50 each person, probably $20-$30 higher than Mastro’s, BOA, etc.",5,5,5,4,2020-03-15 00:00:00,True

After about 5 minutes the waitress appeared and I told her that we would start with champagne, foccacia and salad immediately but she responded that we had to order everything at the same time or the chef wouldn’t even look at the order. So we sat and decided the entire order which I then shared with waitress. I ordered lots of food and then asked if we could order more just in case we wanted more afterwards and was told that it depended on whether or not they needed to turn the table. The sides came out first and after a few minutes we served them and them finally ate them before the meet arrived. I brought the service issue to my servers attention and she then proceeded to avoid me even though I had told her earlier that i was picking up the tab for our party of 6. Empty water glasses and plates left on the table between courses. I flagged down other servers or personnel to get service.

Service is always terrific, and if this had been my first visit, I probably would have loved it, but since we have seen Chi Spacca at its most spectacular, this visit was a bit of a letdown.",5,4,5,4,2020-02-28 00:00:00,False

The oil-soaked bread with burrata, the little gem salad, the plate of citrus (a wonderfully refreshing palate cleanser before the main course), the broccoli, and the lemon posset with balsamic were all delightful. The only dish that my made my partner and I look at each other and say anything other than, ""Wow, this is perfect,"" was, surprisingly enough, the meat entree. We ordered the Porcini Rubbed Beef Short Ribs, and I have to say that the salsa verde was more enjoyable than the meat itself. They tasted overcooked and were somewhat lacking in flavor. That being said, we still cleaned the plate as the short ribs would still blow most out of the water - even if they didn't live up to the chi Spacca standard. Our service didn't meet the typical standard of a award-winning restaurant, either. Our server was not very attentive and we had empty, dirty plates stacked in front us more than once, though I suppose this is better than an over-attentive server, and it may be because we chose counter seating rather than a table.

chi SPACCA,Dallas,"I really wanted to like this place. While the food was about what was expected, the entire experience was a huge let down. First, we were seated 45 minutes after our reservation, and then it took another 30 just to get service. The restaurant has about 5 tables total, so the fact we RARELY saw our waiter the entire TWO HOURS it took to eat was also extremely unfortunate. The courses came out 30 minutes apart, which was very strange to have a bowl of mashed potatoes sit there for half an hour until the first meat came out. Our waters were never filled, and I think I only got one beer the entire meal because our waiter literally never came back after we ordered our food. Except one time to apologize for how long everything was taking. I will say they gave us complimentary sorbet at the end, probably because it was now 11PM and we were just eating. While the food is tasty, I really don't believe the restaurant is as fine as it seems to have convinced itself it is.

Coppa,New England,"COPPA REVIEW 3/3/20We ate at Coppa 5pm yesterday and it was our first negative experience there, such that I am asking: “Does Coppa have a new chef ? ” Well the surprising answer, for me, is No. But why does he want to obliterate the clean dependable Island Creek Oyster flavor by over soaking it in a strong cranberry vinegar? All I can figure is that maybe the chef’s ego is greater than his wanting to showcase his excellent local product. The answer for me was to lift each oyster out of its overpowering vinegar bath , blot it, and eat it as is. Fantastic. The Celery Caesar was as scrumptious as ever. The scallop app. was nuanced and layered with unctuous treatments. The Arancini remain our favorite in the city. The very disappointing entrees were the Gemelli with its muddled flavors, and the Pizza which the menu description never mentioned- was covered with chili flakes. Our waitperson [she must be new] was slow and inattentive no matter how much we urged her to deliver our food.

Then she returned with sarcastic attitude denying our claim. She brought a punch of complete different walnuts and asked to us with the same attitude what we wanted another salad or discount the older one from the account.

I was disappointed that I could not swap out the pasta I wanted with my main choice. But they did tell us in the beginning that they wouldn't do what I wanted them to do.

Again, huge portions, and if we had known we would have paid the split charge and shared. We noticed other diners around us with pasta “entree” that were also huge portions. We ended up leaving half of each pizza. The pizzas were good; not outstanding. We were expecting an outstanding pizza after all the awards and publicity about Crust.

CRUST,New York Area,"We came across an article stating this was one of the 25 best pizza places in the US. Sadly, we completely disagree. While we acknowledge the service and hostess in the restaurant as being pretty extraordinary, having greeted us as we walked in like she couldn't wait to have us for dinner, and the server was quite attentive checking in to see we were good, the pizza was such a disappointment. Based on reviews we'd seen we'd say CRUST over-promises and under-delivers.Our Margarita pie came right out of the oven piping hot on a glass plate. Having lived in Brooklyn, worked in Manhattan for years, plus spending many yummy times at Pepe's in New Haven, CT we can say their crust just lacked flavor and crunch. Really no char on this crust. In fact, it was slightly soggy and really sort of tasteless. It needed salt. None of the lovely oil from the cheese running down your arms will be found here. We also shared a mediterranean salad. Vinegar to oil ration was off so the dressing was a bit heavy with the vinegar, but the ingrediants were fresh. I'm gluten free (not the pizza eater in the family) and CRUST was really great about managing my dietary needs. I had the chicken picatta, which was nice because they grilled the thinly pounded breast vs flouring it. Thumbs up for that. As posted by other reviewers the portions are large and you will be bringing some home. (Sharing plates in the restaurant $3)",3,2,5,3,2020-02-16 00:00:00,True

I can say every dish exceeded my expectations.  The bison and mushroom aperitifs were my personal favorite and I'm usually not a fan of mushrooms.

Every bite was creative and perfectly balanced- a foodie’s dream. Checks all the boxes of what I look for when seeking a new exciting experience. 1. He created things I would never imagine- familiar flavors blended into something new and sensational.2. I could never create this in my house.3. Creates a whole world and experience. For three hours I was removed from time and space and enjoyed one Devine culinary sensory sensation after another of taste smells and textures.Hit every note perfectly like a symphony- the room decor, the lighting, the service, the timing, the wine,  and of course the food.If you are a true foodie ( in search of the next great bit- no matter where - fine dining to food cart) then you must experience Daniel and if you miss and are in search of a whole true fine dining experience put Daniel somewhere top of your list.",5,5,5,5,2020-02-18 00:00:00,False

Unfair to call it a sushi restaurant since it is much more than that. You may wish to peruse the menu online before you go. In the cold section we loved hamachi and avocado salad. I was not a fan of the king oyster mushroom but partner liked it. It's too rubbery for my taste.On the  ""crispy"" menu, the wings were wonderful. next time I'd like to try the Japanese fried chicken. We had the beef dumpling in broth that was delicious. My menu said beef soup dumplings which they are not. Partner's menu just said the correct ""beef dumpling."" Crab udon delish but not much crab. My favorite offerings at the restaurant are the Robotayaki especially the ribeye and Kobe beef. You may want to order double and triple of those. The lobster claw was also great. No room for dessert.

Fishing With Dynamite,Seattle,We really liked this place and enjoyed everything about our early reservation. We seated on time and enjoyed a great sunset view. Our service was spectacular and really added a lot to our experience. The food didn’t disappoint either.  We had oysters (a must); a crab cake (my hubs said it was the best he ever had); the sweet potato dish (that was dynamic and the highlight of the meal for me): grilled prawns (which were cut in half and served in the shell); the mixed greens (this dish was a perfect pallet cleanser); and the finale was thE key lime pie (wowowowow)!

Do not be fooled by the food : time - we left quite satisfied by the portions.It was an amazing dining experience with our favorites being an early course Pistachio encrusted Foie Gras and the Grilled Dock to Dish Tilefish.

Gabriel Kreuther,New York Area,"Let me get right to the point - this was a very disappointing experience for us. For the amount we paid for this “special Valentine’s dinner” (we were celebrating my husband’s birthday), the 7- course menu (excluding the amuse bouche and petit fours) was “just ok”. I didn’t want to use mediocre to describe it, as there were some fantastic elements like the Dry aged duck and red apple consommé en gelèe.  Everything else fell flat in my opinion. I just didn’t think it was worth that kind of money. For a very steep price tag of $1K, every bite should’ve elicited a “wow!”, but it didn’t. Not to mention from a Michelin rated restaurant at that. To add insult to injury, our server announced at the start of dinner that they have added a dish to their menu which is Risotto and black truffle for an additional $50 pp. We declined, as we’ve anticipated a wonderful evening ahead of us. We couldn’t have been more wrong.  Spend your hard-earned money elsewhere. Per Se, Jean Georges, and Le Bernardin would be considered reasonable compared to GK, with amazing food to boot. Alinea in Chicago is very much worth the price tag - from start to finish. You would leave on cloud 9 and have the fondest experience ever ( we still dream about it to this day).

Geronimo,San Francisco,"Always terrific.

Have you ever had that one great employee at a restaurant? Everyone was like that. The valet, the hosts, the assistants, and the servers. The only downside is that no one else can live up to this experience! Dining will never be the same for me. I'm really glad to see a restaurant doing it right.

Girl & the Goat,San Francisco,"We haven't had this much fun dining out in a very long time.  Girl & the Goat is an utterly delightful restaurant, especially if one gets to sit at the ""chef's table"" which overlooks the long counter of prep/grills/etc.  If you want to be able to watch all the prep and interact with the chefs, go early.  If you want to watch an eye-popping and frenzied ballet as the chefs create your dinner, go later in the evening.The waitpeople are personable, unhurried and offer excellent advice as they guide you through menu.And now to the food.  Inventive, unusual & most of all delicious.  Of the 6 varied dishes [veggie, fish & meat] plus dessert, we particularly enjoyed the duck tongue and the goat liver patÃ©.  Not a single misstep.

Girl & the Goat,Chicago,"We had a 5:30P reservation on Tuesday night and were lucky enough to get seated at one of the Chefâ€™s Table. We had the opportunity to watch Chef Izard expedite orders and the chefs in the kitchen. The chefs interacted with us as their workload allowed. It was an awesome experience for foodies. We ordered the bacon Gouda bread, kohlrabi salad, branzino, crispy short rib, and goat belly confit. The bread was good, but unnecessary if youâ€™re looking to save room and calories for other items on the menu. The kohlrabi salad was delicious! My non-veggie eating husband went back for seconds and thirds and named the dish his favorite of the meal. We highly recommend it. The Branzino was my favorite dish of the meal. The chef responsible for preparing the fish was stationed right in front of our table, so we got to see its preparation. Served whole, this dish may be intimidating to some, but the crispy skin, tender meat, and the crunchy farro paired with the sauce was the PERFECT bite. Another dish that we highly recommend. The crispy short ribs were perfectly crispy on outside and tender on the inside and were paired with grapefruit and avocado. The meal itself was delicious, but the dish itself wasnâ€™t our favorite- too citrus forward for our liking. The goat belly confit was paired with crab and a vanilla sauce, and a composed bite of that dish made me drop my fork and close my eyes. It was PERFECTION!! Chef Izard ordered us a mini portion of the green beans on the house, and they were delicious! The beans were so perfectly charred and paired with sliced cashew and a garlic sesame sauce. Neither of us are huge fans of green beans, but this dish challenged our opinion. Again, highly recommend. To finish the meal, we ordered the Carmel corn & malt balls. Our server mentioned that it was one of their most popular desserts, and it was truly delicious. There was an unique contrast between the luxurious ice cream and the crunchy corn. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!",5,5,4,5,2020-03-03 00:00:00,False

Girl & the Goat,Chicago,"This is my third visit in seven years and the food is always top notch. We ate the Ora King Salmon Poke, Pig Face, Duck Tartare, Pork Shank, Escargot Ravioli, Apple Gjetost Pierogi and drank the Goat's Choice (Scotch, Beet Juice, Lime) and Don't Carrot All What You Think. We had the Gets Better with Sage and Fireside at the bar while waiting for the table; top notch drinks. The Ora King Salmon Poke was the most flavorful and impressive dish followed by the Duck and Pig Face. The Pork Shank was surprisingly over salted so we took it home to add some sugar for balance. We sat at a two seat, slim table behind a barrier to the people getting trashed at the bar. I understand the West Loop is getting more expensive with each Instagram-flex post and want to make use of each square footage, however, the restaurant should reconsider the layout of sitting a two person table near the super loud bar and kitchen area that will make any introverted foodie lose their enjoyment of food. Luckily, my significant other thoroughly enjoyed herself on her birthday even if the Girl and the Goat staff did not acknowledge her.

Giulia Restaurant,New England,I wish the initial question above had an “insure” option.   The appetizer and antipasto options were great but I thought the main entrees or the secondi section had only one vegetarian option.  Also the wines understanding were all Italian wines but it would have been quite useful to have better descriptions to those less familiar with Italian wines.Also it was a bit of a tease to hear a one minute plus  description of the special entree only to discover the price of the dish was $65 inflated by the addition of truffles.,4,3,5,3,2020-01-10 00:00:00,False

Giulia Restaurant,New England,"Giulia has been on my list to try for awhile, as one of the top Italian restaurants in Greater Boston. It lives up to the hype. This was a pre-theater dinner for 2 couples. We tried the flatbread, scallops, and prosciutto appetizers all of which were terrific. Then we all ordered different pasta dishes.

Giulia Restaurant,New England,"Generally Giulia lives up to its high reputation; among other points, it is an entirely successful Italian substitute for the sort of high-quality classic French cuisine that has more or less vanished from Boston in the last decade. Our octopus starter with Umbrian lentils was delicious, but outmatched both by the pasta and steak, both of which my partner and I shared. Although everything was done to perfection, the mushroom and kale elements in the pasta sauce and the aioli accompanying the steak were particularly superb. The selection of Italian wines by the glass was slightly narrow but excellent.In reviewing a restaurant of Giulia's quality, it is surely not churlish to cavil at minor slips. Prosecco was rather too close to room temperature. More seriously, the pudding selection was unambitious and strikingly Americanized: no proper Italian pastry was on offer, nor was a cheese option, which by definition requires comparatively little preparation. Nonetheless we found the evening entirely satisfying.",5,5,5,4,2019-12-11 00:00:00,False

Never got a call and missed what I had hoped was going to be great birthday for my wife.  Things get crazy on the coast during a hurricane event and things like forgetting about a reservation you promised to call are going to happen at even the best establishments.  I really want to like this restaurant, as they have plans to open a location near me, so I will wait another 3 months for a Saturday night to open up and give it a second chance.  This review will be updated at that time.  In the meantime, I would recommend other diners be vigilant and double check reservations and conversations with restaurant staff.",1,,,,,False

My son, on an earlier visit with friends, proclaimed to the world that he had enjoyed the best steak he’d ever eaten. My two friends and I concurred that the service was superb and the steaks among the best ever. However, there was one shortcoming: the onion rings!!! I consider myself a connoisseur. The onion rings served that evening were very large - fine - but coated in a heavy, doughy batter. The batter must be light, flaky. Overall perfection is so close.

Harold Black,Washington DC,"I had an amazing time at Harold Black on a Tuesday night.Speakeasy rule -- sit at the bar if you can. You see the art of creating your drink. You hear interesting tidbits and stories. You bond with your bartender and your imagination won't run wild with ideas that you're not important or that this speakeasy is too pretentious. It's not.While the drink menu was a little more limited what I had was great. A truly spicy cocktail with smoky mezcal? Sign me up. Best part? The bartender can customize to your tastes and needs. My friend thought her old fashioned was too sweet. 'No problem, allow me to make you something like a vieux carre and here's exactly why I am using what I am using.' And then thoughtful bar bites which weren't an afterthought for the drink but actually tasty? Gimme that Chicken Tinga Sandwich and an order of the lamb chops for my homegirl please! The R&B music (yaaasssss! to that) had me swaying, the drinks had me relaxed and the convo had me joyful--  this was a laid back speakeasy experience (And trust me, I've tried many in the area).Four stars because it was great time but it truly was a LITTLE too dim and there could be more drinks but I loved this place.

Then after another 10 she brought us one drink (there were two is us) that wasn’t remotely what we ordered. So 45min after we first ordered we got our drinks. There were only about 12-15 of us in the entire bar so it was rather surprising. Throughout the night the bartender also repeatedly spilled iced on the bar and therefore us.

Heirloom Cafe,Toronto,"I'll begin this review by saying that I had been looking forward to, and tried to find an occasion to visit Heirloom Cafe for a very long time. I've lived in San Francisco now for a year and have had dozens of dining recommendations, but I found this one on my own and was excited to visit a local gem in my neighborhood of the Mission. When one of my hometown friends visited, I wanted to bring her, and my local friend in SF for a ladies' dinner on a Saturday night. The food - delicious, presentable, a great portion. We had the fettucine and salmon and both were divine. The wine selection - abundant, knowledgeable, perfectly dry white and rosé to our taste preferences. The ambiance - candlelit, dim, great for close colleagues, friends, or a date. What completely turned us off however, was one of the servers.1. She seemed to be under the influence. Her words were slurred, and she approached our table in jerky movements.2. Our third guest arrived a bit after us, and about a minute after sitting down, the server came to our table and said ""What's the gameplan"" without asking to see if she had a chance to review the menu and decide  3. She accidentally knocked over the entire water decanter onto my friend's seating area, lap, and jacket. she didn't apologize but instead said ""it can be refreshing"". she continued to wipe it while not noticing that she was carrying 2 more decanters in her arm that continued to pour out - luckily a few other servers came to dry up the area 4. We left a nominal tip instead, and she came to the table while we were sitting there, stared closely at the receipt, and marched away to show her manager. Heirloom cafe: your other servers, from what we could tell, seemed to provide good service. We also spoke a few times to who we believe might be an owner and he was great. You should re-consider this server that has left an incredibly bad taste in our mouths and we will not be returning, nor recommending it.",2,5,1,4,2019-08-17 00:00:00,False

Once the most tagged corner in the neighborhood, this sweet little spot now serves fresh, beautiful food with a simple, elegant aesthetic.  The staff is lovely and the meals are beautifully prepared.  The seasonal menu is complemented by a thoughtfully composed wine list -- and to say the atmosphere is charming doesn't begin do it justice.  Behind the gauzy curtains, the hubbub of the City fades away in a grand, open room that quickly fills with a pleasant crowd of diners who've dressed a bit for the occasion, and whose convivial conversations punctuate what always turns into a memorable night.  Even if we didn't live on the same block, we'd love it just as much as we already do!",5,5,5,5,2019-06-07 00:00:00,True

Heirloom Cafe,San Francisco,"Delightful neighborhood spot for celebrating our anniversary. The food and wine were exceptional. The house made fettuccini is a must order (I don't even like mushrooms and this was a standout dish). They also let you share a single order of the prix fixe which is a fantastic deal as it includes generous individual pours and the perfect amount of food to share when you add in an entree. We were both full, but not uncomfortably so. There's no way we could have eaten more! Especially pleased with how perfectly the wine complemented the food (really smart pairings) and how we got to try wines we wouldn't have otherwise known anything about.

We consider ourselves foodies and have dined inside and outside the U.S.   The chef’s selections were delicious.

The Inn at Little Washington,Washington DC,"We visited the Inn last night for our 5th wedding anniversary. This was our first time at the Inn and we appreciate the opportunity. I am going to be honest with my review and please keep in mind that this is my personal opinion. It might sound nitpicky but I think that you earn the right to nitpick if you shell out this amount of money for food :)I have been to one other restaurant with a similar structure and that is Marcel's by Robert Wiedmaier in DC. We went there for our 1st wedding anniversary so I will compare both restaurants.The quality of the cuisine is similar at both restaurants and there is very little that sets them apart. The wine pairing and selections was outstanding at both restaurants. Marcel's provided multiple ""entremets"" between courses and the Inn did not do so. When it comes to table service, the only area where the Inn performed better than Marcel's was the enthusiasm and interaction we received from the waiter, Andrew. However, the waiter at Marcel's was still very good. He performed all his table service at a higher level of technical service. The table was cleaned thoroughly and properly in between courses by Marcel's while at the Inn the table was just not cleaned and cleared properly. The waiter at the table next to us dropped used utensils on a customer which is a massive offense for a 3 star restaurant. Additionally, the sommelier at the Inn poured the incorrect for the wine pairing at dessert. While the experience at both restaurants was very good, Marcel's provided a slightly better dining experience. We certainly did not leave hungry from the Inn and are glad to have the opportunity to dine at an acclaimed restaurant, we think that these little things are worth noting when dining at a restaurant of this level.",4,,,,,False

Service was perfect, we never wanted for anything but were left alone so we can carry on a conversation. Everything felt intimate, romantic, and serene. The highlight was being able to see the kitchen and meet Chef O'Connell. My only small criticism is with the wine pairings. I didn't love a lot of the selections and especially did not like the Riesling. It was so sweet I didn't even drink it. The server who was pouring the wines noticed and commented on my full glass yet never offered a replacement pairing which I would have appreciated.",5,5,5,5,2019-08-10 00:00:00,True

The service is top notch of course I will give it 5 stars there. But negatives were the seating is close quarters; we were sandwiched a foot away from tables on each side of us and more than once an obnoxious woman next to us jumped into our conversation univited.

The Inn at Little Washington,,"Overall the food and experience was good. TLDR is, it's not worth the price, and DO NOT get the wine pairing. Wine pairing was $170/person. It didn't add anything to the dishes, and you only got 2.5 glasses. Getting a cocktail instead of the wine would have saved us at least $200, and would have had the same food experience. Not only did the wine not add to the food experience, but some were just bad. Some of the dishes were amazing, but for those prices I was expecting every dish to blow me away. Can get similar food/experience for 1/4th the price at nice D.C. restaurants. Portions were small, which is to be expected.

It was our anniversary so when sat at the table there was a card to congratulate us and I knew we were in for a great meal. The service is almost robotic in a way where it doesn’t seem fake but a guiñe care for the customer. Food pace is perfectly executed while the service team replaces and replenishes your water, silverware, and bread. Food is being prepared in the back awaiting for the arrival.The food is just as amazing as the service. The sunchoke with Avocado and Ají Dulce peppers is a must try. So is the quail.

Kinship,Washington DC,"Celebrated Valentine’s Day dinner at Kinship.  The customer service was wonderful. The cocktails were great.   As for the food, am not sure if I am happy or disappointed.  I mean, it was great overall. However, comparing it to other fine dining restaurants and/or one starred Michelin starred restaurants, I don’t think they are at par with them.  For example, if I haven tried Marcel’s boudin blanc, I would say it’s great. But, I have to say Marcel’s is better.  And, I would stay away from their Moulard Duck Foi Gras Confit.  I love foi gras and never had a bad one. I have my favorites and not, but I would say theirs is the worst for me.  Overall, it’s a great restaurant. I just can’t say it’s the best one out there.",4,4,5,5,2019-02-15 00:00:00,True

Lahaina Grill,,"Wife and I went here after receiving a $100 gift card from my sister.  To be fair, we would never have gone here if not for the gift card after seeing the prices, we just don't dine at expensive restaurants.  Wife had Pacific Salmon ($49) and I had Boneless Short Rib ($46).  Neither of us drink alcohol.  Wife's Salmon was to come with Asparagus, came with String Beans instead.  Waitress and table assistant did come by a bit but nothing special about the service (I would imagine if we got drinks and an appetizer they would have come by more often but not much of a need with just us getting the dinner plate with no desert).  Her Salmon was OK as was my Boneless Rib but nothing special tasting.  Inside was nice but nothing special and a bit noisy even though we weren't in the main dining area.  No place to park close and plan on $10 or more paid parking unless a few blocks away ($5).  Gift card covered the meals, gave a $20 cash tip.  If you like expensive dinners this place may be good with you, check out the cost with the online menu. We much prefer the Okazuya & Deli Honokowai at 3600D Lower Honoapiilani.  If you've never been there go (take cash, they do not accept credit card and closed on Sundays).  Average dinner price is $17-18, the Mahi Mahi (includes two sides) is unbelievably good as is everything on the menu, it's TAKE OUT so it's perfect for beach dinning or at a condo lanai.

The waitress was nice but had a very odd personality that didn’t seem like she really cares to be there. The tomato in the tomato and mozzarella salad was hard, underripe and had been blanched to peel. Odd. Can’t believe they can charge so much for one tomato and some cheese!

That said, L’Artusi was a wonderful culinary experience, with a thoughtful sommelier who was touchingly unaffected, and a waiter with a sense of irony.  The butter lettuce salad was a marvel, the pasta (kale pyramide) far from the “pile of greens” its name tends to imply to Americans.  That we were the oldest diners in evidence is certainly not a complaint...just a regret for lost dining innocence!",4,4,5,3,2020-01-14 00:00:00,True

Le Diplomate,Washington DC,"It was my mom’s birthday on Jun 17, I was really excited to take her to the restaurant so she could try the duck à l’orange dish. However, due to COVID 19 they don’t serve that entree, which was not a big deal at all.It started to rain when we came in, we sat outside the patio, later on the rain was heavier, so I asked the waiter that was it possible could we move the table to inside a bit cause we sat right on the edge of the patio so my mom got wet. He explained that he couldn’t cause of the social distancing. We all got it. Then I asked him was it possible could him pull the rain cover down a little bit? He answered “sorry I cant”. Then he walked away. We had 5 people, and there was a big table behind us, it was enough for 6 people and he even didn’t bother to ask do we want to move the table or not. Even he saw that we will get wet when we sit there.The service was really bad!! He barely took care off us. He let us sat there more than 20’. So I walked to the host and asked her could we change our table? Then she said “yes”. Foods came out. We order 4 portions of Beef Bourguignon, I got the Half chicken. The chicken was fine. But the beef were really salty. Nothing like I expected. I didnt mean to say everything had to be perfect. But I did trust Le Diplomate is a good restaurant to take my family there to celebrate because I had been there many times. It was good though. Not like this time. We all understand that due to COVID 19 everything is getting harder, but as a big restaurant with good reputation, they should had done so much better than that. I didnt want to complain anything about what happened, but this time it was bad.

She asked for Old Bay seasoning for the Maryland crab soup appetizer which needed help in flavor.My experience was much better than hers. The oyster appetizer and the short ribs over polenta was very good. The only thing was they needed a bit more salt for seasoning.

After visiting Peasant, and meeting and talking with Chef Forgione (and being absolutely blown away by the food) only a week ago for my first dating anniversary with my boyfriend, I decided to take him here for his birthday. We were treated like royalty from the second we walked in, and the food matched the service. We ordered the chicories salad to start. It may sound/seem simple, but that was one of the best salads we’ve ever had. We were also given the Hiramasa tartare dish, which my boyfriend declared the best tartare dish he’s ever had. I had the half chicken (cooked under a brick), and he had the halibut - both outrageous. We had the carrot cake for dessert, but we were also given what the waiter called, ‘The Egg.’ He basically told us to move back in our seats a bit as he proceeded to toss a white chocolate egg filled with passion fruit into a plate ... it was as hysterical as it was delicious, and my boyfriend does not like passion fruit. There are no words that can properly describe this experience. From the card my boyfriend received when he sat down wishing him a happy birthday from the restaurant to the desserts to the sparkling wine to the everything bagel amuse bouche to the amazing atmosphere, this was a one of a kind experience. Simply outrageous, and we will be back.",5,5,5,5,2020-02-15 00:00:00,False

I figured if anyone was going to change my mind about venison, this maybe the only hope. Oh my, it was delicious! I can’t believe how much h I enjoyed it! My friend had the steak.

Marcel's by Robert Wiedmaier,Portland,"We are coming back within two weeks of our first visit. It is rare to have a nice place live up to expectations, but Marcel's did. My husband said this was his favorite meal since we went to French Laundry, and that was about a year-and-half ago of regular restaurant going (West Coast and DC).  We go out to eat a fair amount in all price ranges and in this range, once expects more than just good food. We got great food and great service executed by professionals, not just folks who want to wait tables for a couple years before they move on to their ""real job"". And, yes, it is not a bargain dining hall, but we felt it was a good value for the quality, portions,  presentation, and vibe (great jazz pianist in the lounge, complimentary swank ride to the Kennedy Center for show). Plus, the wines by the glass were priced very accessibly and tasted like much more expensive price points. If you appreciate a more traditional fine dining experience with professional, adult staff and are tired of dropping a couple of bills only to see everyone around you dressed like slobs, make your next date at Marcel's.",5,5,5,5,2020-02-15 00:00:00,False

The food was amazing. There used to be a Washington Post food critic, Donald Dressden (goes way back) I think his name was--when he went to a great restaurant he said the ""food sang"" yep, the food sings here, like Pavarotti on a plate, or something.

Marcel's by Robert Wiedmaier,New England,"This restaurant is without doubt one of the top in the DC area if not the country. My only regret is that I did not try it earlier. The staff - from the owner to the waiters to all who assisted us - were kind, punctual, caring, and welcoming. The chef and cooking staff really know what they are doing and the food is sourced fresh and of highest quality. We ordered from a tasting menu from which one could choose four, five, or six dishes. We chose four, which was more than adequate. Among the three of us we had salad, fish including shellfish, venison, pasta, and several desserts, inter alia. The vegetables were fresh and the cooking afforded succulent, wonderful tasting options. The wine selections ranged from reasonable to pricy, and we were able to get a bottle of a recommended red wine by the glass that was excellent, from a vineyard and vintage that we knew. Expect to pay twice what you would a most high end restaurants but the result will be more than twice as good. I was reminded of an Inn in the countryside in Virginia that has great food, but Marcel's is  better and less expensive. We'll definitely be back!",5,5,5,5,2020-02-05 00:00:00,True

The Cabernet braised short rib was insanely delicious. I was accidentally given a restaurant week menu & the manager was kind enough to honor the discounted prices on the menu I was presented with.

Market Restaurant and Bar,,Went to the Market for my wife’s birthday - overall an enjoyable evening.  We started with the corn soup (great) and burrata cheese & peach salad (good) - we then shared the forest mushroom ravioli (good but incredibly rich & salty) and the grilled beef tenderloin/lobster combo - the tenderloin was again much too salty.  Both my wife and I left with a lingering salty aftertaste and told the waiter as much.  The waiter was very attentive & we appreciated the birthday dessert - just cut back on the copious amounts of salt.,4,3,5,4,2019-09-17 00:00:00,False

I did not complain...at least I thot the tart was edible, but could not explain the taste.My baby gem lettuce salad was ok,  but not as lovely as I expiated, to the eye and the tongue.My friend was aghast that the soup of the day cost 24 dollars, but she ordered it as she was not very hungry (we lunched early...ll:45 )...I was so devastated that I considered, and still am ,  writing directly to Danny Meyer.  He would be horrified had he been at our table yesterday Aug 30. I will not be returning to The Modern, unless an explanation is given.  I can get a beautiful tart d'alsace at BENOIT, as I did on Aug l9...the size of the tart was generous and share - able with 5 other people at my table for drinks and small plates...the size of the MODERN's tart was not even enough for two.Ah well..in the big picture of life I can handle such a disappointment.

I cannot recommend it highly enough. My spouse started with the corn soup, which I had almost ordered. It was very tasty, but nowhere near as good as the avocado. The service was very attentive, with our water frequently refilled and being checked in with regularly.

I tell everyone that I would not order anything we had on a menu , but everything was delicious and so much part of the experience.  We had listened to the pod cast that day about Ko and we had so many questions (need to meet Sean and Sue) . The person who worked with us truly connected and kept adding to our experience.  We asked about the Japanese Cheese Cake mentioned in the pod . She told us she could not get it for us - They it appeared with a candle in it.

We felt that the service was rushed the entire time, from when we first sat down and were asked if we want to put in an order for food before our drink orders were taken to when our water glasses were stripped from the table. Also, we had very little time to enjoy our cocktails before being rushed to order a bottle of wine with our dinner.

Comparing Orchids to the old Maisonette, Boca and Restaurant L (the three legitimate 5-star restaurants we've been to) is a real challenge. Orchids' service staff was above outstanding. Quiet and efficient, the table was cleaned and readied for the next course. The food was wondrous. The seared foie gras, Spanish mackerel, made us want more. The first plates are intentionally small and left us wanting more. Our Monkfish was superbly prepared and surrounded by great food. The chocolate dessert was a wonder. We can't say enough positive about Orchids/ We can also mention that the price was relatively low. Orchids is an unqualified winner.",5,5,5,5,2020-02-28 00:00:00,False

Orchids at Palm Court,Washington DC,"The Orchids is in a spectacular setting in the historic Netherlands Hotel in downtown Cincinnati.

The service is highly attentive and the pacing of the meal was spot on. It was fascinating to watch the choreography of the staff (and the service is clearly choreographed). The staff was friendly, but with a degree of professional aloofness given the more formal dining setting. The prices are expensive although not out of range for the setting. However, the food itself, while well prepared and presented, did not have the distinctive, memorable taste that would befit the prices. I had the ribeye which was well prepared and tasty, but not distinctive. My wife had the flounder which was disappointing in the portion size, taste and accompaniments. We opted to not have dessert, but the restaurant provided some petit fors which were the highlight of the meal. Overall, this is a wonderful place to make an impression and to enjoy a leisurely meal, but is very expensive for the quality and quantity of food.

Orchids at Palm Court,Cincinnati,"This was my second time dining at Orchids at Palm Court.  The first time I dined here was last year and it was fantastic.  This year was a different story.  To start off, it should be noted that this is a relatively expensive restaurant and therefore comes with certain expectations beyond food, service and ambiance being two of them.  We were seated by a very friendly, knowledgeable, and professional greeter, Morgan.  Our server, Oscar, was also very professional.  However, it took 40 minutes from the time we were seated to meet Oscar.  He was extremely busy and for a Saturday night Orchids was poorly staffed--labor cuts?  In any event, we were looking forward to the actual meal.  My wife ordered the blue cheese beignet salad, popcorn grits, and scallops.  I ordered the beef cheek perogies, maitake/cappelletti, and lamb.  My wife's salad was very overdressed and almost seemed as if there was too much salad dressing on it, then the chefs decided to pour olive oil on it--what a disappointment.  The popcorn grits, on the other hand, were flavorful and delicious and I would definitely recommend this unique and tasty dish!  And my wife's third course of scallops were cooked perfectly.  My order was a different story.  First, my perogies had absolutely no flavor whatsoever-no salt, pepper, herb, or sauce-and therefore was unsurprisingly very bland.  The maitake and cappelletti were terrific and cooked perfectly, and the sauce was a perfect pairing (you should order this).  But sadly, my entrée was lackluster.  The lamb was almost rare and had, once again, no flavor.  The entrée did come with two bites of lamb sausage and creamy polenta, but the what should have been the star of the plate, the protein, disappointed in flavor and the way it was cooked.Along with service being painfully slow, the staff always seemed rushed and in a hurry to leave the table.  The staff was so hurried that for our second course they gave my wife and me the wrong second course.  Loud patrons.",2,2,2,1,2020-01-25 00:00:00,False

For Cincinnati it’s towards the top of the pile but if you’re coming from a larger city with more like options this place falls a little short.

The only negative thing worth mentioning is that they priced the vegetarian tasting menu at the same rate as the omnivore tasting which I feel isn’t comparable cost wise.

It is impossible to say any dish was inferior to any other; all seemed perfect (and were presented on beautiful dishes too). The service was attentive but not intrusive. The space was elegant and comfortable and we scarcely noticed anyone else.

No apology, but rather an excuse that the wine was “probably married with something else”(!) was given. Seriously. The waiter was a touch smug and casual bordering on unprofessional.

Since our last visit the bar area within Per Se has been turned into tables for dining so they have increased their covers.When we did get in we still had to wait for our table and so sat at a high bar area.

This was semi short notice so the only time available was for Lunch on Saturday. Everything about the restaurant was super outstanding, especially the service, which is becoming rated these days. Unfortunately we were next to a table, they’re not that close, of four that included a 12-13 year old boy. It’s not that children are bad, it’s the failed parenting strategies that have forgotten about the seldom seen and never heard theories of children in upscale public places.

The cuisine is original, and diverse with flavors that coax and tease the taste buds. The quality of ingredients is unrivaled; so much so that ""Bread and Butter"" is an entree - ""A smoked Paprika 'Parker House Roll' served with Diane St Clair's Animal Farm Butter."" Diane has 10 cows that she milks and hand churns the butter. No detail is left to chance. All chairs that are not required are removed from the table (before you arrive) so as not to disturb the intimacy. There are as many servers as there are guests who move stealthily to present your next palate-stimulating tasting.No matter your requirements (allergies, vegan, etc) Chef Keller and his staff will ensure that you literally have the meal of a lifetime.",5,5,5,5,2018-04-20 00:00:00,False

I made reservations serval weeks in advance and then felt a little uncomfortable where they sat us. Also waiter forgot to bring our appetizer which ended up being the only thing we ordered because we were tired of waiting. It’s a beautiful place but I’ve been to many many high end restaurants and I’ve never felt more uncomfortable. I was even dressed well and carried a designer bag just to try and fit in more but that didn’t seem to make a difference. I don’t need to go back. Ps the chips and salsa and guacamole are awful.

It is something we’ve always looked forward to and it pains me to say that I do not think we’ll be back after the disappointing service. Our reservation was at 3pm and while I do have knowledge of break time and transition from lunch to dinner service, it does not justify the lack of follow up, service, or attention that we had on Wednesday. The server had forgotten a beverage, never to return after. We had to reach out to a backwaiter to get the bill and subsequently left after as we were barely tended to for over 20 minutes.Sad to say that it our tradition has ended at your beautiful restaurant.",1,2,1,3,2019-12-25 00:00:00,False

PRESS,Orange County,We had dinner tonight at Press and we were looking forward to an excellent dinner. Our server was very nice and we Were seated promptly. The restaurant was not very busy and we looked over the menu and list of wines by the glass as well as an iPad loaded with 60 pages of wines. We ordered an appetizer and it was ok but bland. We then had a glass of cab and a Chardonnay that were recommended and they were awful. The cab tatted tainted and the Chardonnay from Mayacamas was really odd tasting. We ordered some fish and a steak and they were not very good. The halibut was tasteless and served cold. The sauce was even worse. The steak was served medium rare after asking for medium well. The flavor was not good either and it was served sliced. At this point we decided to leave. This is our third poor experience at Press over the past 18 months.

There is a sign asking people to make sure that the outside door is closed before opening the inside door.

You could tell she cared about our experience which I really appreciated.

The new owners have masterfully sustained legacy dishes (read: Maribar) and interlaced new and creative dinners and appetizers alike.This is to say nothing of their par excellence dining room staff. The wait staff, host, support, and coat check are all extremely professional, lively, and not the least bit pretentious or robotic.Lastly, we always end our visit with a walk around the wonderful grounds and adjacent areas.

Since we both got the tasting we each got a different plate at each course. We decided to split each course and the food was absolutely amazing. I got to eat many foods I’ve never tried before and i can’t speak more highly of the chef’s talents. Crab, Scallops, lobster, lamb, carpaccio, halibut, BLT, duck, everything was amazing.

Saint Jacques French Cuisine,Raleigh,"We have LOVED Saint Jacques in the past, but I had a bad dining experience over lunch last week. What I was hoping for as an indulgent treat turned into a virtual nightmare. Ambiance: There were three VERY chatty and loud women in the restaurant, to the point where I could hardly hear myself think. I discreetly asked about their meal status (wrapping up, etc.), and the lovely waitress shared that they had finished - not so. I had to endure their political and gossipy conversation for an hour - could not wait to leave. Food: Again, we typically love this restaurant, but my seafood soup was gritty and the entree very rich. My posting is not so much as a warning about their food, but a heads-up to check out how loud the restaurant might be during your dining experience.",1,1,3,1,2020-02-04 00:00:00,True

Saint Jacques French Cuisine,Raleigh,"Decided to try this place based on other reviews. We were not disappointed.  It is quaint, although located in a strip mall, they have done  good job of making the inside feel warm and inviting.  The attention to detail was nice.  Things like seating us apart from other diners when the restaurant was not yet full (we were there at 5:30) and offering dark linen because we were wearing black were appreciated. Aso,asking about allergies before beginning service, and waiting for our complete order so that the plating of all courses could be expertly timed.   Our favorite was the coquilles st jacques appetizer.  The beef bourguignon was hearty and delicious and my filet was actually medium rare which almost never happens. ( I do wish i had felt more adventurous and ordered maybe the fish special, because I decided I do prefer a good amount of char on a grilled steak, but that is personal preference. ) The butter cookies to take home were a lovely touch.  Overall a wonderful experience and we really appreciated a quiet spot for  conversation at the end of a busy week.  Perfect for a date night.",4,4,4,4,2020-01-31 00:00:00,False

Saint Jacques French Cuisine,,Selected this restaurant for a lunch birthday celebration.  Would definitely not recommend.  The facilities are run down which was the 1st clue.  The service was just okay and food middling at best.  Salad was fresh but vinaigretee was bland - basically like eating plain lettuce out of the bag.  Escargot main tasting element was the parsley.  Stingy with the bread - one tiny piece at a time unless asked for additional.  French onion soup okay - had better at the Outback.  Bourguignon meat was tough and salty with very little vegetables.   Saumon Rôti à la Croûte de Basilic was terrible - birthday girl picked this and didn't finish 1/3 of the dish.  Crêpe Saint Jacques was ok.  Needles to  say we didn't order any dessert.

The box was given to one of the other guests at my table , fortunately they came back to my home for coffee and dessert and we were able to make the switch #2 when I opened my box to put the leftovers in a plastic container my crab imperial was NOT included with my leftovers and that really angered me because I purposely saved my crab to be enjoyed Sunday! And the extra that I paid for was waisted! I immediately called your restaurant but of course got voicemail and so  I left a message about my experience. Of course I did not hear back from anyone.

What keeps Steve and Cookies by the bay from being a five star restaurant? 1) Presentation. It is barely above the dreaded “food on a plate” category, it is far short of artful. 2) Attire of assistant waiters who all wear printed black tee shirts, fine at the shore but it is not the dress of a 5 star restaurant. 3) Blatant racism in work expectations. Waiters almost all seem to be white work at a good pace and take the time to be pleasant, assistants in black tee shirts work at a frenzied pace of a car wash as if expecting to be fired at any second. Almost all of the sub class appear to be Hispanic. This just isn’t seen anymore. Very good meals and very good service in a rather plain atmosphere, solid 4 star stuff.",4,4,4,2,2020-03-05 00:00:00,True

Sushi Nakazawa - Sushi Bar,New York Area,"As a huge Sushi Nakazawa fan, I was more than excited to take my brother to lunch at the sushi bar for his birthday. I was lucky to eat here last year and had an absolutely fantastic experience - which made me even more dissapointed in my most recent experience. My brother has celiac disease, which can be an issue at other restaurants, but Sushi Nakazawa reassured us that accommodating his dietary restrictions would not be an issue - we made sure to call ahead of time, remind the host, and checked with our waiter twice. But unfortunately, within an hour after eating, my brother was extremely sick. We had the same exact meal and I was completely fine. When you're paying the prices that you do at Sushi Nakazawa, and have been reassured that they can handle customers with celiac, it's quite frustrating when they fail to do so. The next day I called the restaurant to let them know what happened and the host kindly said they would have management follow-up, but 2 weeks have passed and I haven't heard anything - not even an apology. Shocking when you expect high quality customer service from a restaurant of this quality.

The prix fixe menu rotates every six weeks and reflects an eclectic set of courses employing ingredients and techniques from around the world. There are two dishes offered for each of the four courses, so go with a loved one and taste every offering. I've gone twice so far and each of the eight dishes I've tried has been creative and excellent. The noise level is low enough to talk comfortably but the tables are separate enough to keep conversations private. You can tell that the staff team is tight knit and enjoys working together. They are supremely knowledgeable and engaged with each other and the patrons, and with little separation between the kitchen and the tables, you can see the food prepared with care. All in all, an ideal restaurant experience. I will go as often as I can.",5,5,5,5,2020-02-18 00:00:00,False

The Table at Season To Taste,New York Area,"Unfortunately a mixed bag here.  The food was very well prepared but the menu is extremely limited -- just two choices.   If you didn't like tripe or skate wing (and we didn't), you were out of luck.  However, the real problem was the truly horrible music and the volume at which it was played.  I like everything from Metallica to Bill Evans.  This was just loud noise with a heavy bass.  My guess is that it was there primarily for the chefs in the open kitchen, but it was blaring throughout the tiny dining room.  It was the kind of loud noise the CIA would use to extract a confession.  It ruined the experience completely.  The value proposition is poor at best at $150 a person with beer, no wine.  The chair are hard, no table cloths, and the decor was essentially nonexistent.  A few plastic flowers.  Overall, a huge disappointment.  Excellent bread and butter though.",2,4,3,1,2020-01-08 00:00:00,True

The Table at Season To Taste,New England,"This was a repeat visit and we enjoyed the dinner. The chicken that was served was very tasty but was not elevated to a fine dining experience.  Serving chicken as part of a fine dining menu is risky and this time it did not really paid off. My preference is that the restaurant stick to higher quality meats.  Also, I love bubbly wine with my meal and the only choice by the glass started at $17/glass.

It was fantastic, and the reputation of the restaurant is deserved. However, there was an intangible missing from the food that kept the meal from entering the upper echelon of meals I’ve had.

The waitstaff can tell you the details of each one and why it goes with the particular dish. It's not overbearing wine-speak it's genuinely interesting information.

Luckily, we were able to celebrate our 6 month anniversary together in the outdoor garden of Talula’s 6/15! Although our reservation was delayed/late by 30 minutes, the staff was super friendly, very apologetic, and professional. As a nice gesture, the beverage manager gave us each a glass of Prosecco on the house. We were extremely appreciative and understood the longer wait time given new social distance guidelines. As an aside, this restaurant frequently surprises you with beverages, desserts, etc on special occasions (I have had this happen on 2 prior special occasion dinners). Talula’s food, service, and ambience (as per usual) was off the chart! Thank you for being an amazing date spot and being one of my favorite restaurants in the city!

Talula’s Garden,Philadelphia,"I’ve heard of Talula’s Garden many times as one of the MUST dine places in the city... I had even seen photos and was delighted at the opportunity to go for my birthday. I think that some of my expectations were let down, as it’s as pretty but I think I expected a lot more ambiance from “the garden” than it offered in design. It was also much TOO dark. We were in the most lit area (right next to the light wall) and we had trouble seeing. Just to exit the restaurant my one friend had to use a flashlight. It’s definitely not disability friendly at all. The staff was nice, the food was great. Overall it was a lovely beautiful night, and the food was very satisfying. We ordered the beef short ribs (4.5 ⭐️), scallops (3.5 ⭐️) and beets (4 ⭐️). I’ll say the one uncomfortable moment was when waiting for the check to sign, I noticed a manager or higher up kept staring us down as if we were over staying out welcome. This kept on after we signed. It was a party of 4 at 9:30 at night, and we had barely stayed 65 minutes at that point with a 8:15p reservation. It was extremely uncomfortable, and honestly made me wonder if it was racial possibly with us being probably the only or one of the only tables of POC.

There was a dying poinsettia in the window sill next to our table; it almost spring.  We had to signal to order cocktails.  The food was very good and the wine was very good.  The variety of food was excellent and they prepared a salad course for my wife which was not on the menu.  It was very good.  Pricing was good.

Townsend,Philadelphia,"This may be a great spot-  but only after they fix some startup problems.Our table was not ready at our reservation time but there is under zero space to wait - except at the overcrowded bar (with others waiting to be seated) so we hung out in a window area. We had a wonderful server who took our order for a nice bottle of wine (from a moderately interesting list). A runner then brought us the obligatory bread basket along with an amuse-bouche of vinegared beets, one of which he  overturned onto the table linens - but made no offer to even cover the large and expanding beet red amoeba shaped stain with a napkin.Our first courses - a nice potato potage and baked oysters with (I recall) Pernod were quite well prepared. Our mains, a duck breast and a fish with a leek and other vegetable purée were both well prepared - but suffered from an obvious many too many minutes late delay in getting from the kitchen to the table. We passed on desert as nothing on the limited selection spoke to us.This is a work in progress. Most of the “rough edges” we felt were managed around by a wonderful and obviously experienced server (who we well tipped) but it’s hard to not get the feeling that the front and back of the house need some more time working together.Last - it’s a fine dining restaurant.  It needs some acoustic treatment as the noise level was close to that of a sports bar until later in the evening when the number of patrons was at a minimum.We will give it a few months and return.",3,4,5,4,2020-01-25 00:00:00,True
Townsend,Philadelphia,"First time at the new location (but several times at the old)- so my advice now is - ask for a table against the wall or upstairs.  The window tables are very cold in winter and the one nearest to the service station is distracting. The food - well, I just don't get the hype!  It's good but not spectacular in any form.  Sweetbreads were overly large and thus contained significant cartilage.  Tuna nicoise was grainy... in general the entire meal was overly salted.  Maybe I'm being picky but for a top place it was disappointing and all this was reflected in prior visits.",3,4,2,3,2020-01-25 00:00:00,True
Townsend,Philadelphia,Seating was swift when we arrived with our reservation (which we made 15 mins prior); the food was all fantastic - from the amuse-bouche to the sophisticated dessert.

Townsend,New Orleans,"I have never left a poor review. We were really looking forward to trying Townsend as we have heard great things. However, the food was extremely mediocre - some lukewarm, some so hot as if out of a microwave. It lacked any real flavor. The foie gras mousse was gummy like glue and the duck was questionably duck. The only thing actually worth eating were the oysters. Our meal was so disappointing we immediately walked to Friday, Saturday, Sunday where we know we can get a top-notch, perfectly executed meal with staff that don’t seem like robots. Just having a reputation for good food won’t do much unless you only serve people who would be happy eating at Applebee’s every night. We won’t be returning.",3,2,3,3,2020-01-24 00:00:00,True

True Food Kitchen - Chicago,Chicago,We are regulars at true food. My daughter and I both commented we didn’t know if there was a new shop or something had changed with the cooking. We order the new appetizer the lettuce wrap made with jackfruit. It was very salty.I ordered the shrimp tacos in a lettuce wrap. There were two small tacos and nothing really on the side  except a small side of lettuce. A far change from their fish taco that used to be on the menu. I feel like the prices have gone up the portions have gone down and so has the quality of the food.

It was in a great location and the restaurant itself is spacious and beautiful - not typical for many restaurants in the city.  Food was very good - we went with the server's recommendations and were not disappointed.  My husband had the fried chicken sandwich and I had the Egg and Tortilla.  I asked for scrambled eggs instead of fried egg and it was no problem.  We had mimosas and Bloody Marys and then finished with the Donuts. We wouldn't normally do that but the donuts were recommended.  Enjoyed the experience from start to finish - we will definitely be back.,5,4,4,5,2019-11-02 00:00:00,True

She tried to take our appetisers away when we were half way though and when we said we weren’t finished yet, she decided she would change our plates for some unknown reason...then a minute later our mains arrived so we ended up not actually being able to enjoy the rest of our appetisers!  It was quite embarrassing because I had a guest in from out of town and got them to cancel their reservation at L’Artusi to come to Upland instead!  I really hope it was a one off be side I really do enjoy Upland, but next time I will think twice before returning since New York is full of great restaurants with great service.",3,5,1,5,2019-10-28 00:00:00,True

We shared an order of donuts at the beginning and the jelly donut was the best I have ever had - huge shout-out to the pastry chef :) All three of our meals were pretty stellar - my one and only hesitation is that it can get quite costly but with that being said, the portions are quite large and we all three had food to-go for later.

The atmosphere is so lovely and comfortable! The food was excellent. The sausage and kale pizza is phenomenal. Usually I don't like thicker pizzas but this one managed to be thick without being too heavy or soggy. The crust was crispy and the flavor was out of this world. We also enjoyed the burger very much.

The beginning was with a creatively tasty aperitivo, served with fois gras pastrami on a slice of brioche, high temperature baked and charred cauliflower, smoked duck breast and crudities with a balsamic mayonnaise. Then the serious food started.... hamachi crudo with a creative use of citrus to give it sparkle, onion crepe, with perfectly caramelized onion that took 2 days to make. We tried six different pastas, all delicious; however, for me the ricotta ravioli were incredible.... light as a feather, creamy, and, again, set off with a creative use of citrus In keeping with the season. The real showstopper were three perfectly cooked and sauced Nantucket scallops, topped with a generous serving of ostera caviar and tiny house-made potato chips. So good I felt we should eat this dish on our knees. Entrees hadn't even been started at this point. Spit-roasted goat... tender, juicy with crunchy skin and a salt-baked bronzino were secondi.

We opted for the surprise-but did not do the optional wine pairing (too much alcohol for a couple of light-weights!). My wife has very distinct food dislikes and I am very adventurous and chef was marvelous at meeting both our preferences! The portions were small and manageable, the food was gorgeous and delicious.

Vetri Cucina,Austin,"My favorite part of this whole experience was constructing the tasting menu. Our server, Tara, came to our table and announced we were to have a discussion regarding what we enjoy eating and what we do not. Was there anything we felt we absolutely needed to try? Any ingredients of which we are particularly fond? I wish every restaurant with an unset tasting menu did this, it's brilliant. Ultimately, we did not choose any particular courses, so it was a surprise, but a surprise built around our tastes. There were six main courses, 3 bread courses, an amuse-bouche, and a couple mignardises. Every other main course had an additional entree we shared. Our tasting menus were completely different from one another, so we were able to try each other's entrees as well. Overall, we tried a little over 20 dishes. All of them were exquisite and definitely on the richer side. I was pretty full about two-thirds of the way through.What made the experience amazing, food aside, was our brilliant server. Tara is an absolute food genius, emotionally intelligent, and easy to understand. Her knowledge is vast and gave an immediate answers to every question without missing a single beat. Playful and understanding, she intuitively knew when to give us space as well as when to swoop in with another brilliant display. Truly a magical night and reunion with my father, made special by Tara. P.S. I'm sorry for tripping you, I still feel guilty!",5,5,5,5,2019-11-20 00:00:00,False

Although intrigued at first by the completely different decor, the dark space and thumping techno music just wasn't for me. It was too loud and too club-like for what we had in mind.

Atmosphere was loud but not too loud--I felt like we could talk without being overheard and vice versa.  They offer some really fun drinks.  I ordered one that was spiced up for the holidays.

Zahav,Chicago,"I'm not sure if we were there on an off service night but from when we arrived to when we left our experience was less than stellar.  You arrive & its quite chaotic, table wasn't ready upon arrival for our reservation for us & many others waiting in front of us.  Our server was the highlight of the night, she was great throughout our experience.  One of the items we came for was the famous Slow Cooked Lamb Shoulder.  When asked about it for the tasting menu, we were told they were out already, for a 7:30 reservation which is ridiculous when you can get bar seating without reservations earlier & can order it.  Our experience continued downhill from there.  Drinks took forever to come out & our food was coming out under cooked, over cooked & cold as we watched the table next to us who sat down 15 minutes after us & took forever to place their order get their food before us having also ordered the tasting menu.  Our steak looked well done while theirs came out right after ours looking as if it was just pulled off the grill.  They left & paid before us.  The ""pusher"" responsible for reviewing & releasing the food wasn't doing a great job.  We watched tables around us get food at completely random times with long waits, short wait & no cadence.  The food was rather forgetabble. We have an Israeli restuarant in Chicago that across the board all their dishes were better especially for the price.  The hot hummus was the best part of the meal.  Reservations are so hard to get & the fact you don't get asked during your reservation if you are interested in their signature dish would make one assume you can't request ahead of time but first come first serve.  There is no information regarding any of this on their website.  If you are going for that dish, get a bar seat or make 5pm reservations.  We are fortunate to travel all over the world & try all types of local food but for us a place with so much hype we would not recommend to our friends based on our overall experience.",3,2,4,3,2019-07-26 00:00:00,True

There was only one problem which detracted significantly from our experience: the noise level. The music was so loud (and not particularly interesting or cool) that we couldn’t hear ourselves talk. We couldn’t even hear the servers trying to carefully explain the contents of each dish, which was a real bummer. I asked a few times for them to repeat what they said, but then I just gave up. We were very interested in knowing about each dish and chatting about that at dinner. That is kind of the point of a tasting menu.

I was happy that they were able to be seated prior to my arrival. The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. The food was amazing and they had a good amount of vegetarian options. The drinks were super tasty as well! They offer small plates and they are pretty filling. The hummus is a must get. My dad hates hummus and he even said that this was the only hummus he’s ever had that actually tasted good. If we weren’t so stuffed, I definitely would’ve tried the dessert, but maybe next time!",5,5,5,5,2019-07-10 00:00:00,False

Zero Restaurant + Bar,New York Area,"We loved the food at Zero and the outdoor setting was lovely. I would have given 5 stars except for the fact that it was all a little precious. And why is the 4-course $65 menu not presented?  We knew about it from going online but then no sight of it. Then we’re told it’s a pre-theater menu. Pre-theater in Charleston???

Zero Restaurant + Bar,Charleston,"This is a very special restaurant, unlike any we've experienced in Charleston. They have a multi-course tasting menu - only - so there's not a menu with a plethora of choices. But everything we were served was phenomenal; dreamed up and prepared by a true culinary genius. The service was some of the best we've experienced anywhere.  Every service person was 100% professional and accommodating, while also being engaging and warm. There is no other place like this in Charleston. With high-end food and service, physical comfort and delightful ambiance, it has quickly moved into the #1 slot of our ""Favorite restaurants in Charleston"" list! The only caveat I might mention is that each course is tiny. We left very satisfied but were hungry about three hours later. Even so, we can't wait to go back!",5,5,5,5,2019-04-11 00:00:00,False

Zero Restaurant + Bar,Tampa,"The food was exceptional as always and I have ranted and ravedAfter each experience here.  However, it was a bit unnerving to have a very loud and inconsiderate table of 4 (clearly not locals...as determined by their accent and lack of dining room etiquette) in the middle of the very intimate and not-sound-proofed dining area.I know we are all there for the ambiance and the food, and despite anyones “occasion”...if we are having a meal and  spending upwards of 400$ for a dinner for 2, I would expect that a manager would politely request a loud and noisy group to tone it down. I enjoy a good time and can get loud but this is not the place.Regards and see you soon",5,5,5,5,2019-03-27 00:00:00,True

The tasting menu in itself and the relaxed pace with which the meal took place was something I was looking for. The food is very good; too much happening at times for a Nordic taste, but still above the default. Really fine wine pairing.

Chef made accommodations based on my boyfriend's eating limitations and was thoughtful about it. However, I would not recommend this restaurant mainly based on value.  For what we paid, we expected to be completely blown away. If the price had been lower, we would've been much more impressed, but given how expensive it was, this should have been an unforgettable meal. However, during our weekend in Charleston, we had two much better dining experiences that were much better value. All of the dishes at Zero were very much style over substance. Unique and artsy plating could not make up for how ordinary all of the food was at a place that tries very hard to be extraordinary.",3,3,5,5,2019-02-16 00:00:00,True
