13,Barclay Prime,Denver,"I do not normally leave reviews but I was disappointed overall in the experience. While our server was great, both in my party had to send back the steaks because they were overcooked-all gray color in a Med Rare steak. As we finished the recooked meal, it appeared we were being rushed and ultimately while trying to order another round of drinks were told by a nervous waiter that we had to leave because of the time limit on the table. Mind you it was 9 and they closed at 10 (no one really seen waiting) and we were still drinking and contemplating dessert, and again, had earlier had to wait 20+ minutes for new steaks and sides. The waiter again apologized but said it was a management rule and claimed they were booked later as he presented us with our check. Nothing removed for the food issue and a check of $450 to which we noted once more would be more and were dumbfounded that a restaurant would not continue to serve two people spending this amount, to which he nodded and appeared embarrassed. I know this is the era of COVID where we are told we should just be thankful for the restaurant to be open but this was not a positive experience, especially for the price.",3,2,5,3,2020-07-17 00:00:00.000000,True,MLCJ,1

I took a chance on Open Table and the hit was a great one.Chef is from Sicily.  Restaurant located in a former home in Venice, and is absolutely charming. The wait staff and all were very attentive and the food could not have been more delicious.  Not inexpensive, but worth every dollar.  Delish!

The service was impeccable started with the wine pairing from the extensive list.  It's a 4-course dinner menu with least two options per course, but you can get Ã  la carte if you sit at the bar. For pricing, everything is determined by the fourth course of your choosing. I chose the ""Dijon Brushed New Zealand Lamb Rack"" which was $120. While my mother (whom I brought for long-overdue Mother's Day dinner) ordered the ""Niman Ranch USDA Prime Ribeye"" which was $135. The other three courses are included in that price. We also ordered the add-on ""Hudson Valley Foie Gras"" which was out of this world--my mom loved it so much that she wouldn't save any for me. Dessert is extra, ours were $12 each.

I had the short rib.  It was beautifully cooked and tender, and the portion size was quite large.  The flavorful, hearty sauce really tied the dish together.

376,Uchi - Dallas,,"We were quickly seated upon arrival for our reservation. Our waiter, James was polite and welcoming which I wouldn’t expect anything less. My date and I ordered the 10-course tasting – ultimate chef’s choice and it was nice that James asked questions about our likes and dislikes and what we enjoy more of. James also asked if it was okay to have other people bring out the dish and/or pick up the plates. I was absolutely fine with the question but found it made the dining experience with different servers less personal by the end of the night. The other staff that brought the plates were polite but I wish they took the time to elaborate on the meal(s) instead of making a rushed dull statement; it would have made the omakase experience more polished. James checked on us often but I’m still puzzled why there are numerous people to drop off and pick up the plates. It’s a small concern since the tip was between 18%-20% on Omakase pricing and I’m not sure if it’s split among those who approached our table or strictly our server; it seems like a team effort. Overall, James is really great. The dining experience is nice; I enjoyed having the lights dimmed for a while then lighting up the room which shifted the ambiance. The lighting seemed to rotate every time a new plate arrived to our table which set the mood for the new tasting.

387,UMI,Jacksonville,"OMG.... this restaurant is absolutely AWESOME!!!! They have come up with a fun whimsical way to enforce social distancing.... with beautiful statues donned with interesting headgear having dinner next to ya.To give ya an idea of how succulent the food was... my 2 year old son & I came here for dinner two nights out of the four we were here for vacation. My favorite sushi items were the specialty sushi like sake aioli and yellowtail/otoro caviar. If you can’t decide which to get, I recommend the otoro b/c it just melts in your mouth! The aburi sushi were good, but I have had better at other Japanese restaurants.The wagyu beef was absolutely divine!! It’s pretty pricey at $33/oz (minimum 2 oz) but TOTALLY worth it! I think it was better than the Kobe beef I had in Kobe, Japan! The Chilean sea bass was a little dry but great flavor. The fluffy cheesecake was good but didn’t like the banana glaze that it was soaked in.This is my new favorite Japanese rest!!",5,5,5,5,2020-07-17 00:00:00.000000,True,OpenTable Diner,15
